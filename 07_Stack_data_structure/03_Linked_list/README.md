## Introduction

The stack data structure is a fundamental component of computer science and is widely used in various applications. This implementation utilizes a doubly linked list to achieve efficient push and pop operations, enabling dynamic storage of elements.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

To better understand the stack using a doubly linked list, let's consider an example:

```python
# Create a new stack
stack = DoublyLinkedListStack()

# Push elements onto the stack
stack.push(10)
stack.push(5)
stack.push(7)

# Pop an element from the stack
popped_element = stack.pop()

# Peek at the top element
top_element = stack.peek()
```

Visualization:
```
|    7    |  <- Top
|    5    |
|   10    |

```

## Why Should You Learn It?

Learning about the stack data structure using a doubly linked list offers several benefits:

- **Versatility:** The stack is a fundamental data structure that is widely applicable in programming and problem-solving scenarios.
- **Efficiency:** The doubly linked list implementation provides efficient insertion and removal of elements compared to other data structures.
- **Understanding Algorithms:** Many algorithms and data structures rely on the stack concept, making it essential to grasp for further learning.

## Real-Life Example

A real-life example of a stack can be found in web browsing. The browser's back button utilizes a stack to keep track of previously visited web pages. Each time you visit a new page, it is pushed onto the stack. When you click the back button, the most recently visited page is popped from the stack, allowing you to navigate back through your browsing history.

## How It Works

The stack using a doubly linked list operates as follows:

- It consists of nodes, where each node holds an element and maintains references to the previous and next nodes.
- The top of the stack is represented by the head node, while the bottom is represented by the tail node.
- When pushing an element onto the stack, a new node is created and inserted at the top, updating the head node accordingly.
- Popping an element removes the top node from the stack, updating the head node and returning the popped element.
- Peeking at the top element retrieves the value without modifying the stack.

## Complexity Analysis

The

 complexity of operations in the stack using a doubly linked list is as follows:

- Push: O(1) - Constant time complexity, as inserting a new node at the top requires updating a few pointers.
- Pop: O(1) - Constant time complexity, as removing the top node involves updating pointers.
- Peek: O(1) - Constant time complexity, as retrieving the top element only requires accessing the head node.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of the stack using a doubly linked list:

- Efficient insertion and removal of elements at the top (head) of the stack.
- Dynamic resizing of the stack when required.

Disadvantages:

- Higher memory overhead due to the additional pointers in each node compared to other stack implementations.

## Algorithm

The stack using a doubly linked list follows the following algorithmic approach:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Implement operations to push, pop, and peek.
3. Maintain the head and tail pointers to keep track of the top and bottom of the stack.
4. Update the pointers accordingly during push and pop operations.

## Pseudocode

The pseudocode for the stack using a doubly linked list can be represented as:

```
class DoublyLinkedListStack:
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value
            self.prev = None
            self.next = None

    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def push(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else:
            new_node.next = self.head
            self.head.prev = new_node
            self.head = new_node

    def pop(self):
        if self.head is None:
            return None
        elif self.head == self.tail:
            value = self.head.value
            self.head = None
            self.tail = None
            return value
        else:
            value = self.head.value
            self.head = self.head.next
            self.head.prev = None
            return value

    def peek(self):
        if self.head is None:
            return None
        else:
            return self.head.value
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

The memory representation of the stack using a doubly linked list depends on the number of elements stored. Each node in the doubly linked list requires memory for the value, a reference to the previous node, and a reference to the next node.

Suppose each element in the stack occupies `E` memory units, and the pointers require `P` memory units. If the stack contains `N` elements, the total memory required can be calculated as:

```
Total Memory = N * (E + 2P)
```

## Memory Allocation

Memory allocation for the stack using a doubly linked list is dynamic, as it adjusts based on the number of elements in the stack. When a new element is pushed onto the stack, memory is allocated for a new node to store the element and maintain the necessary pointers. Similarly, when elements are popped, the corresponding memory is deallocated.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection plays a crucial role in managing the memory used by the stack using a doubly linked list. When elements are popped and nodes become unreachable, the garbage collector identifies and reclaims the memory associated with those nodes.

## Limitations of Stack using Doubly Linked List

Some limitations of the stack using a doubly linked list include:

- Higher memory overhead compared to other stack implementations due to the additional pointers in each node.
- Limited by the available memory resources, as the stack size cannot exceed the available memory.
