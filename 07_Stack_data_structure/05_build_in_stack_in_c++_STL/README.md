## Simulation and Example

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  stack<int> st;
  st.push(10);
  st.push(20);
  st.push(30);
  st.push(40);

  st.pop();
  cout << st.top() << '\n';
  st.pop();
  cout << st.top() << '\n';
  st.pop();
  cout << st.top() << '\n';
  st.pop();

  return 0;
}
```

**Simulation:**

In this example, we are using the built-in stack in C++ to perform various operations. Here's a step-by-step simulation:

1. Initialize an empty stack `st`.

2. Push elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` into the stack using the `push()` function.

3. Perform the `pop()` operation on the stack to remove the top element (`40`).

4. Print the top element of the stack using the `top()` function, which will be `30`.

5. Perform another `pop()` operation on the stack to remove the top element (`30`).

6. Print the top element of the stack, which will be `20`.

7. Perform another `pop()` operation on the stack to remove the top element (`20`).

8. Print the top element of the stack, which will be `10`.

9. Perform the final `pop()` operation on the stack to remove the last remaining element (`10`).

**Why Should You Learn It?**

Understanding and utilizing the built-in stack in C++ is essential for various reasons:
- Stacks are fundamental data structures used in many algorithms and applications.
- They provide a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, which is useful in situations where the most recently added element needs to be accessed or removed first.
- Learning about stacks helps in understanding other data structures like queues and can be used as a building block for more complex data structures.

**Real-life Example**

A real-life example where stacks are commonly used is the undo/redo functionality in text editors or graphic design software. Each change made is stored as an operation in a stack. When the user performs the undo operation, the most recent change is reversed by popping it from the stack. Redo operations can be implemented by maintaining a separate stack for undone changes.

**How It Works

**

The built-in stack in C++ is implemented using an underlying container, such as `std::deque` (double-ended queue) or `std::vector`. The stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

**Complexity Analysis**

The complexity of operations on the built-in stack in C++ is as follows:

- Push: O(1)
- Pop: O(1)
- Top: O(1)
- Size: O(1)
- Empty: O(1)

**Advantages and Disadvantages**

Advantages of the built-in stack in C++:
- Easy to use and readily available in the C++ Standard Library.
- Efficient implementation with constant-time complexity for most operations.
- Supports standard stack operations such as push, pop, top, size, and empty.

Disadvantages of the built-in stack in C++:
- Limited functionality compared to custom stack implementations.
- Cannot be customized or extended beyond the provided operations.

**Algorithm**

The built-in stack in C++ does not require an algorithm as it is provided as a ready-to-use data structure in the C++ Standard Library.

**Sudo Code**

No sudo code is needed for the built-in stack in C++ as it can be directly used with its member functions.

**Memory Representation with Calculation**

The memory representation of the built-in stack in C++ depends on the underlying container used for implementation, such as `std::deque` or `std::vector`. The memory usage is proportional to the number of elements stored in the stack.

**Memory Allocation**

Memory allocation for the built-in stack in C++ is automatically handled by the underlying container used for implementation. The container dynamically manages memory as elements are added or removed from the stack.

**Garbage Collection**

Garbage collection is not applicable for the built-in stack in C++ as it is managed by the C++ memory management system.

**Limitations of Built-in Stack in C++**

Some limitations of the built-in stack in C++ include:
- Limited functionality compared to custom stack implementations.
- Inflexibility in terms of customizing or extending the stack beyond the provided operations.
- Dependency on the C++ Standard Library, which may restrict portability to other programming languages.
