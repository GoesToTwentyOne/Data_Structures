## Introduction

A queue is a fundamental data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It allows elements to be inserted at the rear and removed from the front. This repository provides an implementation of a queue using a circular array in C++. The circular array allows efficient memory utilization and avoids the limitation of fixed-size arrays.

## Why You Should Learn It?

Understanding and implementing a queue using a circular array is important because it provides a more efficient way to manage and manipulate data in a queue compared to using a static array or linked list. Learning this data structure helps in understanding circular arrays, memory management, and efficient utilization of resources. It is a fundamental concept that is widely used in various computer science applications.

## Real-life Example

A real-life example of using a queue with a circular array can be seen in the management of tasks in an operating system. The operating system schedules tasks in a queue, where each task is executed in a specific order. By using a circular array implementation, the operating system can efficiently manage the execution of tasks and ensure fair scheduling.

## How It Works

A queue implemented using a circular array works by maintaining two pointers, `front` and `rear`, which point to the front and rear of the queue, respectively. Initially, both pointers are set to -1 to indicate an empty queue. When an element is enqueued, the `rear` pointer is incremented, and the element is inserted at the `rear` position. If the `rear` pointer reaches the end of the array, it wraps around to the beginning of the array, allowing circular behavior. Similarly, when an element is dequeued, the `front` pointer is incremented, and the element at the `front` position is removed. If the `front` pointer reaches the end of the array, it wraps around to the beginning. This circular behavior allows efficient memory utilization.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for various operations on a queue implemented using a circular array is as follows:
- Enqueue: O(1)
- Dequeue: O(1)
- Front: O(1)
- Size: O(1)

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of using a circular array for implementing a queue:
- Efficient memory utilization compared to static arrays.
- Constant time complexity for enqueue and dequeue operations.
- Simple implementation.

Disadvantages of using a circular array for

 implementing a queue:
- Limited maximum size due to the fixed-size array.
- Potentially wasted memory space if the array size is much larger than the number of elements in the queue.
- The circular behavior can make the code slightly more complex.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for implementing a queue using a circular array is as follows:

1. Initialize an array of a fixed size.
2. Set the `front` and `rear` pointers to -1 to indicate an empty queue.
3. When enqueueing an element, increment the `rear` pointer and insert the element at the `rear` position. If the `rear` pointer exceeds the array size, wrap it around to the beginning of the array.
4. When dequeuing an element, increment the `front` pointer and remove the element at the `front` position. If the `front` pointer exceeds the array size, wrap it around to the beginning of the array.
5. Implement additional functions like `front`, `size`, etc., based on the requirements.

## Pseudocode

```
class Queue:
    // Initialize the circular array and pointers
    Array queue[max_size]
    Integer front = -1
    Integer rear = -1

    // Enqueue an element
    Enqueue(element):
        If rear + 1 == max_size:
            Print "Queue is full"
            Return
        End If

        rear = (rear + 1) % max_size
        queue[rear] = element

    // Dequeue an element
    Dequeue():
        If front == rear:
            Print "Queue is empty"
            Return
        End If

        front = (front + 1) % max_size

    // Get the front element of the queue
    Front():
        If front == rear:
            Print "Queue is empty"
            Return
        End If

        Return queue[(front + 1) % max_size]

    // Get the size of the queue
    Size():
        Return (rear - front + max_size) % max_size
```

## Limitations of Queue Using Circular Array

The limitations of using a queue with a circular array include:
- Limited maximum size due to the fixed-size array.
- Wasted memory space if the array size is much larger than the number of elements in the queue.
- Difficulty in dynamically resizing the circular array.
- More complex code compared to using dynamic arrays or linked lists.
