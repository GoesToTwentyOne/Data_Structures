## Simulation with Example
The following C++ code demonstrates how to convert numbers from 1 to n into their binary representation using the built-in queue in C++ STL:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <bitset>

int main(){
  int n;
  cin>>n;
  queue<string> q;
  q.push("1");
  for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
    cout<<"Binary representation of "<<i<<" is :-> "<<q.front()<<'\n';
    // Store temp
    string temp = q.front();
    q.pop();
    // Add '0' and '1' to the queue
    q.push(temp + "0");
    q.push(temp + "1");
  }
}
```

## Why You Should Learn It?
Learning how to convert numbers from 1 to n into their binary representation using a queue in C++ STL can enhance your understanding of data structures and algorithms. It allows you to efficiently generate binary representations, which can be useful in various applications such as encoding, decoding, bitwise operations, and more.

## Real-Life Example
Binary representations are commonly used in computer systems for data storage, communication protocols, and bitwise operations. Understanding how to convert numbers into their binary form using a queue can be beneficial when working with low-level programming, network protocols, or embedded systems.

## How It Works
The algorithm uses a queue to store and generate binary representations of numbers from 1 to n. It starts by pushing the initial binary representation "1" into the queue. Then, for each number from 1 to n, it pops the front element from the queue, prints it as the binary representation of the current number, and adds two new elements to the queue by appending "0" and "1" to the popped element.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the given number. This is because the algorithm performs a constant number of operations for each number from 1 to n. The space complexity is also O(n), as the queue stores a maximum of n binary representations.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages:
- Efficient generation of binary representations from 1 to n


- Simple implementation using the built-in queue in C++ STL
- Applicable in various scenarios that involve binary operations

Disadvantages:
- Limited to converting numbers from 1 to n into binary representations
- Requires additional memory to store the binary representations in the queue

## Algorithm
1. Read the input value of n.
2. Create an empty queue of strings.
3. Push the initial binary representation "1" into the queue.
4. Repeat the following steps for i = 1 to n:
   - Pop the front element from the queue and store it in a temporary variable.
   - Print the binary representation of i as the popped element.
   - Append "0" to the popped element and push it into the queue.
   - Append "1" to the popped element and push it into the queue.
5. End.

## Sudo Code
```
Read n
Create an empty queue q
Push "1" into q
for i = 1 to n:
    temp = front element of q
    Print binary representation of i as temp
    Pop the front element from q
    Push temp + "0" into q
    Push temp + "1" into q
end for
```

## Memory Representation
The memory representation for the queue using the built-in queue in C++ STL is automatically handled by the compiler. The queue dynamically manages memory for its elements, expanding or shrinking as needed.

## Memory Allocation and Garbage Collection
Memory allocation and garbage collection are handled by the C++ STL library. The queue dynamically allocates memory for its elements and deallocates it when elements are removed from the queue.

## Limitation of 1 to n Binary Conversion using Queue: Built-in Queue in C++ STL
- The algorithm is limited to converting numbers from 1 to n into their binary representation. It does not support negative numbers or fractional numbers.
- The maximum value of n may be limited by the available memory resources.
