```**Basic Terminologies:**

In the field of data structures and algorithms, it's important to understand the following key terms:

**Data**: Data refers to values or sets of values that can be processed by a computer. It can exist in various forms, such as numbers, text, or binary format. Data items are individual units of data.

**Group Item**: Group items are data items that are divided into sub-items. For example, an employee's name can be divided into three sub-items: First name, Middle name, and Last name.

**Elementary Item**: Elementary items are data items that are not divided into sub-items. For example, a social security number of an employee is an elementary item.

**Attribute/Field**: An attribute or field is a single elementary unit of information representing a characteristic or property of an entity. Examples of attributes or fields include Name, Age, and Gender.

**Entity/Record**: An entity or record is something that has attributes or properties which can be assigned values. It represents a single unit of data. For example, an employee of an organization can be considered as an entity or record with attributes such as Name, Age, and Gender.

**Data Structures:**

A data structure is a mathematical or logical model used to organize and store data in a particular way that allows for efficient operations. Data structures provide a means to represent and manipulate data for various applications.

Different types of data structures exist, including:

1. **Arrays**: Arrays are a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. They provide fast and direct access to elements using an index. Arrays are ideal for situations where elements have a fixed size and need to be accessed quickly.

2. **Linked Lists**: Linked lists are a sequence of elements called nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements but have slower access times compared to arrays.

3. **Stacks**: Stacks are a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added or removed only from one end of the stack, called the top. Stacks are commonly used in programming for tasks like function call management and expression evaluation.

4. **Queues**: Queues are a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear end and removed from the front end. Queues are used in scenarios where operations need to be performed in a specific order, such as job scheduling.

5. **Graphs**: Graphs are a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They represent relationships between objects and can be used to model complex systems like social networks or transportation networks.

6. **Trees**: Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and subsequent child nodes. Each child node can have its own child nodes, forming a tree-like structure. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as file systems or organization structures.

7. **Files**: Files are a way of storing and organizing data on secondary storage devices. They are used to store and retrieve information for long-term storage.

**Data Structure Operations:**

Data structures support various operations to manipulate and process the stored data. Some common operations include:

1. **Traversing**: Accessing each record or element of a data structure to perform certain operations or retrieve specific information.

2. **Searching**: Finding the location of a particular record or element with a given key value or satisfying specific conditions.

3. **Inserting**: Adding a new record or element to the data structure.

4. **Deleting**: Removing a record or element from the data structure.

5. **Sorting**: Rearranging the data in a specific order, such as ascending or descending.

6. **

Merging**: Combining two or more sorted data structures into a single sorted structure.

Understanding these operations and their associated time and space complexities is crucial for designing and implementing efficient algorithms and data structures.

It's worth noting that there are primitive and non-primitive data types. Primitive data types are predefined by the programming language, such as integers and characters. Non-primitive data types, also known as reference variables or objects, are created by the programmer and can hold complex data structures.

By learning data structures and their operations, you can effectively organize and process data, leading to more efficient and optimized algorithms in various real-life applications.
