# Stack Implementation using Template (Generic Programming)

This repository provides a stack implementation using template (generic programming), which allows you to create a stack of any data type. The stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the most recently inserted element is the first one to be removed.

## Introduction

The stack implementation using template provides a flexible and reusable data structure for storing elements. By utilizing generic programming, the stack can be instantiated with any data type, allowing for greater versatility in various applications.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

Let's simulate the stack implementation using an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::stack<int> st;

    st.push(10);
    st.push(20);
    st.push(30);

    while (!st.empty()) {
        std::cout << st.top() << " ";
        st.pop();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
30 20 10
```

Visualization:
```
Stack:   [30]
         [20]
         [10]
```

## Why Should You Learn It?

Learning the stack implementation using template offers several benefits:

- **Code Reusability**: The template allows the stack to work with any data type, promoting code reusability in different projects.
- **Flexibility**: The stack can be easily adapted to various use cases and requirements by changing the data type.
- **Versatility**: Understanding generic programming concepts expands your knowledge of C++ and enables you to work with other generic containers and algorithms.
- **Foundation for Advanced Data Structures**: The stack serves as a fundamental data structure and forms the basis for more complex data structures like queues, trees, and graphs.

## Real-Life Example

A real-life example where a stack is used is in the implementation of an undo feature in a text editor. Each action, such as typing or deleting a character, can be stored as a command in a stack. When the user wants to undo an action, the most recent command is popped from the stack and reversed, effectively undoing the action.

## How It Works

The stack operates on the principle of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). Elements are added to the top of the stack and removed from the top. The stack provides the following operations:

- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
- **Top**: Retrieves the top element from the stack without removing it.
- **Empty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack

.

## Complexity Analysis for All Operations

The complexity analysis for the stack operations is as follows:

- **Push**: O(1)
- **Pop**: O(1)
- **Top**: O(1)
- **Empty**: O(1)
- **Size**: O(1)

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of using the stack implementation using template:

- **Flexibility**: The stack can handle any data type, providing flexibility in designing applications.
- **Code Reusability**: The template allows the stack to be easily reused in different projects.
- **Efficiency**: The stack operations have constant time complexity, making it efficient for many applications.

Disadvantages of using the stack implementation using template:

- **No Random Access**: Stack elements can only be accessed from the top. Random access to elements is not supported.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for the stack implementation using template is straightforward:

1. Create a class or structure for the stack.
2. Define the necessary operations like push, pop, top, etc.
3. Use a data structure such as an array or linked list internally to store the elements.
4. Implement the operations based on the chosen data structure.
5. Test and verify the functionality of the stack.

## Pseudocode

The pseudocode for the stack implementation using template:

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Stack {
    // Define necessary variables and data structures

public:
    void push(T value) {
        // Implement push operation
    }

    void pop() {
        // Implement pop operation
    }

    T top() {
        // Implement top operation
    }

    bool empty() {
        // Implement empty operation
    }

    int size() {
        // Implement size operation
    }
};
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

The memory representation of the stack using template depends on the chosen data structure. For example, if an array is used internally, the memory will be allocated sequentially.

Memory calculation for the stack:

- Each element in the stack occupies the memory equivalent to the size of the data type.
- The memory required for the stack is the sum of memory occupied by all elements.

## Memory Allocation

Memory for the stack is dynamically allocated based on the number of elements. When the stack size exceeds the allocated memory, additional memory is allocated to accommodate more elements. The dynamic memory allocation ensures efficient memory usage and scalability.

## Garbage Collection

The stack implementation using template in C++ utilizes automatic memory management. The language provides a garbage collector that automatically frees the memory occupied by objects when they are no longer referenced or in use. Therefore, manual garbage collection is not required for the stack implementation.

## Limitation of Stack Implementation using Template

The stack implementation using template has the following limitations:

- **No Random Access**: Stack elements can only be accessed from the top. Random access to elements is not supported.
- **Static Memory Allocation**: If an array is used internally, the memory allocation is static. Once the allocated memory is exhausted, additional elements cannot be added unless the stack is resized.
