# Introduction to Deque

Deque, short for "Double Ended Queue," is a linear data structure that allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends. It is a generalized version of a queue and a stack, providing efficient operations for adding and removing elements at both the front and the rear.

This README.md file provides an overview of Deque, including its functionalities, examples, complexity analysis, advantages, and disadvantages. It also includes an invitation to contribute, acknowledgments, and other relevant information.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

To better understand the operations and behavior of a Deque, let's simulate it with an example and visualize the operations clearly.

```python
# Python code for simulating Deque

# Create an empty Deque
deque = []

# Add elements to the front and rear
deque.append('A')
deque.append('B')
deque.append('C')
deque.append('D')
print("Initial Deque:", deque)

# Remove elements from the front and rear
front = deque.pop(0)
rear = deque.pop()
print("Removed front element:", front)
print("Removed rear element:", rear)
print("Updated Deque:", deque)
```

Output:
```
Initial Deque: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
Removed front element: A
Removed rear element: D
Updated Deque: ['B', 'C']
```

In the above example, we create an empty Deque and then add elements 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' to the front and rear. We then remove the front and rear elements, resulting in an updated Deque with elements 'B' and 'C'.

## Why Should You Learn It?

Learning about Deque can be beneficial for several reasons:
- Deque provides efficient insertion and deletion of elements from both ends, making it suitable for various real-world scenarios.
- It is a fundamental data structure used in algorithm design and problem-solving.
- Understanding Deque can enhance your knowledge of data structures and their applications.
- Deque operations can optimize certain algorithms, leading to improved performance in specific situations.
- Many programming languages and frameworks provide built-in Deque implementations, so familiarity with Deque is valuable for utilizing these resources effectively.

## Real-life Example

A real-life example of using a deque can be seen in toll collection systems at bridges or toll booths. When vehicles arrive at the toll booth, they form a queue and wait for their turn to pay the toll fee and pass through. In this scenario, a deque can be used to efficiently manage the vehicles.

Here's how a deque can be applied in the toll collection process:

1. Arrival of Vehicles: As vehicles approach the toll booth, they join the deque by adding themselves to the rear of the queue. The rear of the deque represents the end of the queue where new vehicles join.

2. Toll Collection: When it's time for a vehicle to pay the toll fee, it moves to the front of the deque. The front of the deque represents the beginning of the queue where the next vehicle in line should be processed.

3. Processing Vehicles: The toll booth operator collects the toll fee from the vehicle at the front of the deque. Once the payment is made, the vehicle moves forward and exits the deque.

4. Continuous Flow: As vehicles continue to arrive at the toll booth, the deque allows for simultaneous processing and efficient management of the vehicles. New vehicles can be added to the rear of the deque, and vehicles can be processed and removed from the front.

By using a deque in the toll collection process, the system can handle incoming vehicles efficiently and maintain a steady flow of traffic. It allows for both front and rear operations, ensuring that vehicles can join the queue seamlessly and be processed in the order they arrive.


## How It Works

A Deque can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The operations available in a Deque include:
- Insertion at the front (`push_front`) and rear (`push_back`).
- Deletion from the front (`pop_front`) and rear (`pop_back`).
- Accessing the front element (`front`) and rear element (`back`).
- Checking if the Deque is empty (`is_empty`).
- Retrieving the size of the Deque (`size`).

Deque supports both LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) operations, allowing flexibility in how elements are added and removed.

## Complexity Analysis for All Operations

The time complexity of common Deque operations implemented using a doubly-linked list is as follows:

| Operation        | Time Complexity |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Push Front       | O(1)            |
| Push Back        | O(1)            |
| Pop Front        | O(1)            |
| Pop Back         | O(1)            |
| Front/Back       | O(1)            |
| Is Empty         | O(1)            |
| Size             | O(1)            |

These time complexities assume a doubly-linked list implementation where each operation can be performed in constant time.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of using a Deque:
- Efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.
- Versatility in implementing various data structures and algorithms.
- Supports both LIFO and FIFO operations.

Disadvantages of using a Deque:
- Implementing a Deque with a dynamically resizing array can be less efficient due to costly memory reallocations.
- Additional memory overhead compared to a simple array or linked list.

## Algorithm and Pseudocode

The algorithm for the basic operations in a Deque is straightforward. Here's the pseudocode for the essential Deque operations:

```
push_front(item):
    Create a new node with the given item
    Set the new node's next pointer to the current front node
    Set the current front node's previous pointer to the new node
    Set the front pointer to the new node

push_back(item):
    Create a new node with the given item
    Set the new node's previous pointer to the current rear node
    Set the current rear node's next pointer to the new node
    Set the rear pointer to the new node

pop_front():
    If the deque is empty, return an error or throw an exception
    Set the front pointer to the next node of the current front node
    Set the previous pointer of the new front node to None
    Return the item of the removed front node

pop_back():
    If the deque is empty, return an error or throw an exception
    Set the rear pointer to the previous node of the current rear node
    Set the next pointer of the new rear node to None
    Return the item of the removed rear node

front():
    If the deque is empty, return an error or throw an exception
    Return the item of the front node

back():
    If the deque is empty, return an error or throw an exception
    Return the item of the rear node

is_empty():
    Return True if the deque is empty, otherwise False

size():
    Return the number of elements in the deque
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

The memory representation of a Deque depends on the underlying implementation. In a doubly-linked list implementation, each node contains the item value, a pointer to

 the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.

Let's assume each item in the Deque occupies a fixed amount of memory (M). In this case, the memory consumption of a Deque can be calculated as follows:

```
Memory Consumption = Number of Elements in Deque * (Memory per Element + Memory for Pointers)
```

Here, "Memory per Element" refers to the size of an item, and "Memory for Pointers" represents the combined size of the next and previous pointers.

## Memory Allocation and Garbage Collection

In most programming languages, memory allocation and garbage collection are automatically handled by the runtime environment or the language itself. When using a Deque, memory is dynamically allocated as new nodes are created to store elements.

Garbage collection is responsible for reclaiming memory that is no longer in use. When a node in the Deque is removed, the memory associated with that node can be deallocated if no other references exist.

The specifics of memory allocation and garbage collection vary depending on the programming language and runtime environment being used.

## Limitations of Introduction to Deque Expandly

While this introduction provides a solid foundation for understanding Deque, it is important to note that it covers only the basics. Deque is a versatile data structure with additional advanced concepts and variations, such as circular deques or dequeues with dynamic resizing arrays. Exploring these advanced topics can provide a deeper understanding of Deque and its applications.
