# Binary Tree Implementation

This code provides an implementation of a binary tree data structure using C++. The binary tree consists of nodes, each containing an ID value and pointers to its left child, right child, and parent.

## Description

The `Node` class represents a node in the binary tree and has the following attributes:

- `id`: An integer representing the ID of the node.
- `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
- `right`: A pointer to the right child node.
- `parent`: A pointer to the parent node.

The `Binary_Tree` class represents the binary tree itself and provides the following functionality:

- `createNewNode(int id)`: Creates a new `Node` object with the given ID and returns a pointer to it.
- `build_Binary_Tree()`: Builds a sample binary tree structure by creating nodes and setting their relationships.
- `print_tree_info()`: Prints information about each node in the binary tree, including its ID, parent ID, left child ID, and right child ID.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided code into a C++ source file (e.g., `binary_tree.cpp`).
3. Compile the source file using your C++ compiler. For example, using `g++`, you can run the following command: `g++ binary_tree.cpp -o binary_tree`.
4. Run the compiled executable. For example: `./binary_tree`.

## Example

Consider the following binary tree structure:

```
             0
            / \
           1   2
          /   / \
         5   3   4
```

Running the provided code will output the following information about each node:

```
NODE: 0, parent: -1, left: 1, right: 2
NODE: 1, parent: 0, left: 5, right: -1
NODE: 2, parent: 0, left: 3, right: 4
NODE: 3, parent: 2, left: -1, right: -1
NODE: 4, parent: 2, left: -1, right: -1
NODE: 5, parent: 1, left: -1, right: -1
```

This output shows the node ID, parent node ID, left child node ID, and right child node ID for each node in the binary tree.

I hope this example helps you create a README.md file for teaching the code. Feel free to customize it further to match your requirements and provide additional details as needed.



Sure! Here's a cheat sheet covering the basics of binary trees:

Binary Trees Cheat Sheet:

1. Definition:
   - A binary tree is a tree-like data structure in which each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

2. Terminology:
   - Node: Each element in a binary tree is called a node.
   - Root: The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root.
   - Leaf: A node that has no children is called a leaf node or a terminal node.
   - Internal Node: A node that has at least one child is called an internal node.
   - Parent and Child: Nodes in a binary tree are connected through parent-child relationships.
   - Depth: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node.
   - Height: The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree.

3. Types of Binary Trees:
   - Full Binary Tree: A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
   - Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
   - Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
   - Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree in which the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.

4. Traversal Techniques:
   - Inorder Traversal: Traverse the left subtree, visit the root, and traverse the right subtree. (Left-Root-Right)
   - Preorder Traversal: Visit the root, traverse the left subtree, and traverse the right subtree. (Root-Left-Right)
   - Postorder Traversal: Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, and visit the root. (Left-Right-Root)
   - Level-order Traversal: Traverse the tree level by level, visiting nodes from left to right in each level.

5. Binary Search Tree (BST):
   - A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left child of a node contains a value smaller than the node, and the right child contains a value greater than the node.
   - BST allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n) in the average case.

6. Operations on Binary Trees:
   - Insertion: Adding a new node to the binary tree while maintaining the binary tree properties.
   - Deletion: Removing a node from the binary tree while maintaining the binary tree properties.
   - Searching: Finding a specific value or node within the binary tree.
   - Height Calculation: Determining the height of the binary tree.
   - Mirror Image: Creating a binary tree where the left and right children of each node are swapped.

Remember to refer to this cheat sheet for quick reference while working with binary trees.
