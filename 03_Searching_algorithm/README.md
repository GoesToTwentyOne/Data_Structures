## What is Linear Search?

Linear search is a search algorithm that goes through each element in the list one by one, until it finds the desired element or reaches the end of the list. It is also known as a sequential search. Linear search is an easy and simple search algorithm, but it is not the most efficient way to search a list.

## How Does Linear Search Work?

Linear search works by starting from the beginning of the list and comparing each element in the list to the element being searched for. If the element is found, the search is complete. If the element is not found, the search continues until the end of the list.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Linear Search

The biggest advantage of linear search is its simplicity. It is also relatively fast if the list is short. However, it is not the most efficient way to search a list, and it becomes increasingly slower as the list grows.

## Conclusion

Linear search is a simple and easy to understand search algorithm, but it is not the most efficient way to search a list. It should be used only when the list is short and the element being searched for is likely to be near the beginning of the list.
