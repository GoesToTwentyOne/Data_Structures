## Introduction

Dynamic arrays provide flexibility in managing collections of data. Unlike static arrays, dynamic arrays can change in size at runtime, allowing efficient memory usage and better handling of varying amounts of data.

This repository showcases various dynamic array operations such as resizing, insertion, deletion, accessing elements, and more.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

The simulation examples and visualizations of dynamic array operations can be found in the [examples](examples) directory. Please refer to the individual README files within each example for detailed information on how to run and visualize the simulations.

## Why You Should Learn It?

Learning about dynamic array operations is important for several reasons:

- Dynamic Memory Management: Understanding dynamic arrays helps in managing memory efficiently by dynamically resizing arrays as needed.
- Data Structure Flexibility: Dynamic arrays provide a flexible and scalable data structure, allowing for efficient storage and manipulation of varying amounts of data.
- Real-Life Applications: Dynamic arrays are used in various real-life scenarios, such as implementing dynamic lists, dynamic stacks, and dynamic queues.

## Real-Life Example

A real-life example of dynamic arrays is a social media platform that dynamically stores and manages user posts. As users create new posts, the dynamic array automatically grows to accommodate the increasing number of posts. If posts are deleted, the dynamic array shrinks accordingly to reclaim memory.

## How It Works

Dynamic arrays work by internally allocating memory to hold the elements of the array. When the array needs to be resized, a new memory block is allocated with a larger size, and the elements from the old memory block are copied to the new one. The old memory block is then deallocated.

## Complexity Analysis for All Operations

The complexity analysis for dynamic array operations is as follows:

- Accessing an element by index: O(1)
- Insertion or deletion at the end of the array: O(1) amortized
- Insertion or deletion at the beginning or middle of the array: O(n)

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of dynamic arrays:
- Resizable: Dynamic arrays can grow or shrink in size, adapting to the amount of data.
- Efficient Access: Elements can be accessed directly using their index.
- Efficient Appending: Inserting elements at the end of the array is efficient.

Disadvantages

 of dynamic arrays:
- Costly Insertions/Deletions: Insertions or deletions at the beginning or middle of the array require shifting elements, resulting in higher time complexity.
- Overhead: Dynamic arrays require additional memory to handle resizing.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for dynamic arrays involves managing the size of the array and reallocating memory when necessary. When the array reaches its capacity, a new larger block of memory is allocated, and the elements are copied to the new block.

## Pseudocode

Pseudocode for dynamic array resizing:

```
function resizeArray(array, newSize):
    newBlock = allocateMemory(newSize)
    copyElements(array, newBlock)
    deallocateMemory(array)
    return newBlock
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

The memory representation of dynamic arrays varies based on the programming language and implementation. Generally, dynamic arrays store elements in a contiguous memory block.

Memory calculation for dynamic arrays:
- Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

## Memory Allocation

Dynamic arrays use memory allocation functions provided by the programming language or runtime environment. The allocation is typically done using functions such as `malloc()` or `new` in languages like C/C++ and Java, respectively. Memory is deallocated using corresponding deallocation functions like `free()` or `delete`.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is a mechanism in programming languages that automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. Dynamic arrays typically rely on the underlying garbage collection mechanism provided by the language or runtime environment.

## Limitations of Dynamic Array Operations

- Dynamic arrays require contiguous memory, which may be challenging to obtain for large arrays.
- Resizing an array can be an expensive operation, especially when the array is large.
- Dynamic arrays may waste memory if the allocated capacity is much larger than the actual number of elements.

## Create a Dynamic Array
To create a dynamic array, you need to allocate memory using the new operator in C++ or the malloc() function in C. The size of the array can be specified as an argument to the new operator or malloc() function.

Here's an example of creating a dynamic array of integers in C++:
``` c++
int* arr = new int[10]; // create a dynamic array of 10 integers
```
Here's an example of creating a dynamic array of integers in C:
``` c
int* arr = (int*) malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); // create a dynamic array of 10 integers
```
## Access Elements of a Dynamic Array
You can access elements of a dynamic array using the indexing operator [] in the same way as a static array.
Here's an example of accessing an element of a dynamic array in C++:
``` c++
int* arr = new int[10];
arr[0] = 1; // assign 1 to the first element of the array
int x = arr[0]; // access the first element of the array
```
## Resize a Dynamic Array
To resize a dynamic array, you need to allocate a new block of memory with the new size and copy the elements of the old array to the new array. Then, you can deallocate the old memory and use the new memory as the new array.
Here's an example of resizing a dynamic array of integers in C++:
``` c++
int* arr = new int[10]; // create a dynamic array of 10 integers
// resize the array to 20 integers
int* new_arr = new int[20];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    new_arr[i] = arr[i]; // copy elements of the old array to the new array
}
delete[] arr; // deallocate the old memory
arr = new_arr; // use the new memory as the new array
```
## Insert an Element in a Dynamic Array
To insert an element in a dynamic array, you need to resize the array to make room for the new element, shift the elements after the insertion point to the right, and then insert the new element at the insertion point.
Here's an example of inserting an element in a dynamic array of integers in C++:
``` c++
// insert 5 at index 2
int size = 10;
int index = 2;
int value = 5;
int* new_arr = new int[size + 1]; // resize the array
for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
new_arr[i] = arr[i]; // copy elements before the insertion point
}
new_arr[index] = value; // insert the new element
for (int i = index + 1; i < size + 1; i++) {
new_arr[i] = arr[i - 1]; // copy elements after the insertion point
}
delete[] arr; // deallocate the old memory
arr = new_arr; // use the new memory as the new array

```

## Delete an Element from a Dynamic Array
To delete an element from a dynamic array, you need to shift the elements after the deletion point to the left and then resize the array to remove the last element.
Here's an example of deleting an element from a dynamic array of integers in C++:
``` c++
int* arr = new int[10]; // create a dynamic array of 10 integers
// delete the element at index 2
int size = 10;
int index = 2;
for (int i = index + 1; i < size; i++) {
    arr[i - 1] = arr[i]; // shift elements after the deletion point to the left
}
int* new_arr = new int[size - 1]; // resize the array
for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) {
    new_arr[i] = arr[i]; // copy elements to the new array
}
delete[] arr; // deallocate the old memory
arr = new_arr; // use the new memory as the new array
```

## For Theory

**Arrays**

Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. Most of the data structures make use of arrays to implement their algorithms. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Array.

- **Element** − Each item stored in an array is called an element.
- **Index** − Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element.
  ## **Array Representation**
Arrays can be declared in various ways in different languages. For illustration, let's take C array declaration.

Arrays can be declared in various ways in different languages. For illustration, let's take C array declaration.


As per the above illustration, following are the important points to be considered.

- Index starts with 0.
- Array length is 10 which means it can store 10 elements.
- Each element can be accessed via its index. For example, we can fetch an element at index 6 as 9.

**Basic Operations**

Following are the basic operations supported by an array.

- **Traverse** − print all the array elements one by one.
- **Insertion** − Adds an element at the given index.
- **Deletion** − Deletes an element at the given index.
- **Search** − Searches an element using the given index or by the value.
- **Update** − Updates an element at the given index.

In C, when an array is initialized with size, then it assigns defaults values to its elements in following order.

|**Data Type**|`        `**Default Value**|
| :-: | :-: |
|bool|false|
|char|0|
|int|0|
|float|0\.0|
|double|0\.0f|
|void||
|wchar\_t|0|
## **Insertion Operation**
Insert operation is to insert one or more data elements into an array. Based on the requirement, a new element can be added at the beginning, end, or any given index of array.

Here, we see a practical implementation of insertion operation, where we add data at the end of the array −
### **Algorithm**
Let **Array** be a linear unordered array of **MAX** elements.
### **Example**
**Result**

Let **LA** be a Linear Array *unordered*

with **N** elements and **K** is a positive integer such that **K<=N**. Following is the algorithm where ITEM is inserted into the Kth position of LA –

*1. Start*

*2. Set J = N*

*3. Set N = N+1*

*4. Repeat steps 5 and 6 while J >= K*

*5. Set LA[J+1] = LA[J]*

*6. Set J = J-1*

*7. Set LA[K] = ITEM*

*8. Stop*
### **Example**
Following is the implementation of the above algorithm −

*#include <stdio.h>*

*main() {*

`   `*int LA[] = {1,3,5,7,8};*

`   `*int item = 10, k = 3, n = 5;*

`   `*int i = 0, j = n;*
\*


`   `*printf("The original array elements are :\n");*

`   `*for(i = 0; i<n; i++) {*

`      `*printf("LA[%d] = %d \n", i, LA[i]);*

`   `*}*

`   `*n = n + 1;*
\*


`   `*while( j >= k) {*

`      `*LA[j+1] = LA[j];*

`      `*j = j - 1;*

`   `*}*

`   `*LA[k] = item;*

`   `*printf("The array elements after insertion :\n");*

`   `*for(i = 0; i<n; i++) {*

`      `*printf("LA[%d] = %d \n", i, LA[i]);*

`   `*}*

*}*

When we compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result –
### **Output**
*The original array elements are :*

*LA[0] = 1*

*LA[1] = 3*

*LA[2] = 5*

*LA[3] = 7*

*LA[4] = 8*

*The array elements after insertion :*

*LA[0] = 1*

*LA[1] = 3*

*LA[2] = 5*

*LA[3] = 10*

*LA[4] = 7*

*LA[5] = 8*

## **Deletion Operation**
Deletion refers to removing an existing element from the array and re-organizing all elements of an array.

`   `printf("The original array elements are :\n");



`   `for(i = 0; i<n; i++) {

`      `printf("LA[%d] = %d \n", i, LA[i]);

`   `}



`   `j = k;



`   `while( j < n) {

`      `LA[j-1] = LA[j];

`      `j = j + 1;

`   `}



`   `n = n -1;



`   `printf("The array elements after deletion :\n");



`   `for(i = 0; i<n; i++) {

`      `printf("LA[%d] = %d \n", i, LA[i]);

3\. Repeat steps 4 and 5 while J < N

4\. IF LA[J] is equal ITEM THEN GOTO STEP 6

5\. Set J = J +1

6\. PRINT J, ITEM

7\. Stop
### **Example**
Following is the implementation of the above algorithm −

#include <stdio.h>

void main() {

`   `int LA[] = {1,3,5,7,8};

`   `int item = 5, n = 5;

`   `int i = 0, j = 0;



`   `printf("The original array elements are :\n");



`   `for(i = 0; i<n; i++) {

`      `printf("LA[%d] = %d \n", i, LA[i]);

`   `}



`   `while( j < n){

`      `if( LA[j] == item ) {

`         `break;

`      `}



`      `j = j + 1;

`   `}



`   `printf("Found element %d at position %d\n", item, j+1);

}
