## Introduction

Searching algorithms are fundamental operations in computer science that involve finding a specific element in a given collection of data. The linear search algorithm checks each element of the collection sequentially until a match is found, while the binary search algorithm divides the collection into halves and narrows down the search space based on comparison with the middle element.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

The simulation with examples and visualizations of linear search and binary search can be found in the [examples](examples) directory. Please refer to the individual README files within each example for detailed information on how to run and visualize the simulations.

## Why You Should Learn It?

Learning about linear search and binary search algorithms is crucial for several reasons:

- Essential Algorithms: Linear search and binary search are fundamental searching algorithms used in various applications and algorithms.
- Understanding Search Techniques: These algorithms teach you different approaches to searching and help you develop problem-solving skills.
- Building Blocks: Linear search and binary search lay the foundation for more advanced searching and sorting algorithms.
- Optimization: Understanding the complexity of these algorithms allows you to choose the most efficient algorithm for different scenarios.

## Real-Life Example

A real-life example of linear search is searching for a name in a phone book. Starting from the beginning, each name is checked until a match is found. Binary search is commonly used in searching for a specific element in a sorted array, such as finding a particular value in a list of students sorted by their IDs.

## How It Works

- Linear Search: In linear search, each element of the collection is sequentially checked until the target element is found or the end of the collection is reached.
- Binary Search: Binary search works on sorted collections. It repeatedly divides the collection in half and narrows down the search space based on whether the middle element is greater than or less than the target element. This process continues until the target element is found or the search space becomes empty.

## Complexity Analysis for All Operations

The complexity analysis for linear search and binary search operations is as follows:

- Linear Search:
  - Best-case Time Complexity: O(1)
  - Average-case Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n)

- Binary Search:
  - Best-case Time Complexity: O(1)
  - Average-case Time Complexity: O(log n)
  - Worst-case

 Time Complexity: O(log n)

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of linear search:
- Simple to understand and implement.
- Works on unsorted collections.

Disadvantages of linear search:
- Inefficient for large collections.
- Requires checking each element.

Advantages of binary search:
- Efficient for sorted collections.
- Reduces the search space by half in each iteration.

Disadvantages of binary search:
- Requires a sorted collection.
- Additional preprocessing step for sorting.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for linear search is straightforward: iterate through the collection and compare each element with the target until a match is found or the end of the collection is reached.

The algorithm for binary search involves dividing the collection in half and narrowing down the search space based on comparisons with the middle element until the target is found or the search space becomes empty.

## Pseudocode

Pseudocode for linear search:

```
function linearSearch(collection, target):
    for each element in collection:
        if element == target:
            return true
    return false
```

Pseudocode for binary search:

```
function binarySearch(collection, target):
    low = 0
    high = length(collection) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) / 2

        if collection[mid] == target:
            return true
        else if collection[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return false
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

The memory representation for linear search and binary search depends on the programming language and data structures used. In both cases, the collection is stored in memory.

Memory calculation for linear search:
- Space Complexity: O(1)

Memory calculation for binary search:
- Space Complexity: O(n) for the collection (array) and O(1) for other variables

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is a mechanism in programming languages that automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. Both linear search and binary search algorithms do not require explicit garbage collection as they utilize memory efficiently and do not create unnecessary objects.

## Limitations of Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search:
  - Inefficient for large collections.
  - Requires checking each element, which can be time-consuming.

- Binary Search:
  - Requires a sorted collection.
  - Additional preprocessing step for sorting.

Linear Search ( Array A, Value x)
Step 1: Set i to 1
Step 2: if i > n then go to step 7
Step 3: if A[i] = x then go to step 6
Step 4: Set i to i + 1
Step 5: Go to Step 2
Step 6: Print Element x Found at index i and go to step 8
Step 7: Print element not found
Step 8: Exit
