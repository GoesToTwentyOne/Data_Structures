# Queue: Built-in Queue in C++ STL

## Introduction
The queue is a container data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. It allows insertion of elements at one end and deletion of elements from the other end. In C++ STL (Standard Template Library), the queue is implemented as a built-in container, making it easy to use and efficient.

## Simulation with Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    myQueue.push(5);
    myQueue.push(6);
    myQueue.push(7);

    std::cout << "Size of queue: " << myQueue.size() << '\n';

    std::cout << "Front element of queue: " << myQueue.front() << '\n';

    myQueue.pop();

    std::cout << "Size of queue: " << myQueue.size() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

## Why You Should Learn It?
Learning the built-in queue in C++ STL offers several benefits:
- It provides an efficient and easy-to-use implementation of the queue data structure.
- Understanding and using the built-in queue can simplify the implementation of algorithms and data structures that require a FIFO behavior.
- C++ STL provides a standardized interface for the queue, making it portable across different platforms and compilers.

## Real-Life Example
A real-life example of a queue is a printer spooler. Multiple print jobs are added to the spooler, and the printer processes them in the order they are received. The queue ensures that each print job is processed in a fair and orderly manner.

## How It Works
- The built-in queue in C++ STL is implemented as a container adapter that internally uses other containers (such as deque or list) to store the elements.
- The elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front, following the FIFO principle.
- The front() function retrieves the element at the front without modifying the queue.
- The push() function adds an element to the back of the queue.
- The pop() function removes the element from the front of the queue.

## Complexity Analysis
The complexity analysis of the built-in queue operations in C++ STL is as follows:
- push(): O(1)
- pop(): O(1)
- front(): O(1)
- size(): O(1)
- empty(): O(1)

## Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages of the built-in queue in C++ STL:
- Easy to use: The built-in queue provides a simple interface for enqueueing and dequeue

ing elements.
- Efficient: The underlying container ensures efficient memory management and access to elements.

Disadvantages of the built-in queue in C++ STL:
- Limited functionality: The built-in queue has a fixed set of operations and may not support additional features required in specific use cases.
- Lack of control: As a built-in container, the queue implementation does not offer direct control over memory allocation or customization.

## Algorithm
The underlying algorithm used in the built-in queue is based on the container used for storage. By default, it uses deque (double-ended queue) as the underlying container.

## Memory Representation
The memory representation of the built-in queue in C++ STL depends on the underlying container used for storage. The elements are stored in a sequential manner, allowing fast access to both the front and back of the queue.

## Memory Allocation and Garbage Collection
Memory allocation and garbage collection for the built-in queue in C++ STL are handled internally by the underlying container. The container automatically manages the memory required for storing the elements, ensuring efficient memory allocation and deallocation.

## Limitation of Queue: Built-in Queue in C++ STL
The limitations of the built-in queue in C++ STL include:
- Lack of customization: The built-in queue provides a fixed set of functionalities and may not meet specific requirements that demand customization.
- Container dependency: The choice of the underlying container affects the performance and memory usage of the queue.
