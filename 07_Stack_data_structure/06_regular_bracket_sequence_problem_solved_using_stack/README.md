## Simulation and Example

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string s;
  cin >> s;
  stack<char> st;

  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    char now = s[i];

    if (now == '(' || now == '{' || now == '[') {
      st.push(now);
    } else {
      if (st.empty()) {
        cout << "Invalid" << '\n';
        return 0;
      } else if (now == ')' && st.top() == '(') {
        st.pop();
      } else if (now == '}' && st.top() == '{') {
        st.pop();
      } else if (now == ']' && st.top() == '[') {
        st.pop();
      } else {
        cout << "Invalid" << '\n';
        return 0;
      }
    }
  }

  if (st.empty()) {
    cout << "Valid" << '\n';
  } else {
    cout << "Invalid" << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

**Simulation:**

In this example, we are using a stack-based solution to validate whether a given string contains a regular bracket sequence. Here's a step-by-step simulation:

1. Initialize an empty stack `st` and input a string `s`.

2. Iterate through each character `now` in the string.

3. If `now` is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), push it onto the stack.

4. If `now` is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), perform the following checks:
   - If the stack is empty, the sequence is invalid, and "Invalid" is printed.
   - If the closing bracket matches the top of the stack (e.g., `now == ')'` and `st.top() == '('`), pop the top element from the stack.
   - If the closing bracket does not match the top of the stack, the sequence is invalid, and "Invalid" is printed.

5. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the sequence is valid, and "Valid" is printed. Otherwise, if the stack is not empty, the sequence is

 invalid, and "Invalid" is printed.

## Why Should You Learn It?

Learning how to solve the regular bracket sequence problem using a stack provides several benefits:

- It helps develop an understanding of stack data structure and its applications.
- It enhances problem-solving skills and logical reasoning.
- Stack-based algorithms are commonly used in various fields, including computer science, software development, and algorithmic competitions.
- Solving this problem demonstrates proficiency in implementing stack operations and handling bracket sequences, which is a fundamental skill in many programming tasks.

## Real-life Example

A real-life example where the stack-based solution for regular bracket sequences is useful is in text editors or code editors. These editors often include features to check for balanced bracket sequences. By using a stack, the editor can validate whether the brackets in the code are properly nested and balanced, providing immediate feedback to the user.

## How It Works

The stack-based solution for the regular bracket sequence problem works by iteratively checking each character in the input string. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets encountered. Whenever a closing bracket is encountered, it verifies if it matches the corresponding opening bracket at the top of the stack. If the brackets match, the top element is popped from the stack. If the brackets do not match or the stack is empty when encountering a closing bracket, the sequence is considered invalid.

After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the sequence is considered valid since all opening brackets have been matched and popped from the stack.

## Complexity Analysis

The complexity analysis of the stack-based solution for the regular bracket sequence problem is as follows:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- Space Complexity: O(n), as the stack may store up to n/2 opening brackets in the worst case.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of the stack-based solution for the regular bracket sequence problem:

- Simple and intuitive implementation.
- Efficient solution with linear time complexity.
- Easily adaptable to handle other types of bracket sequences.

Disadvantages of the stack-based solution for the regular bracket sequence problem:

- Only suitable for validating bracket sequences.
- Requires additional space to store the stack.

## Algorithm

The stack-based solution for the regular bracket sequence problem does not require a specific algorithm as it relies on the principles of stack data structure and bracket matching.

## Sudo Code

No sudo code is needed for the stack-based solution as the provided code directly solves the problem.

## Memory Representation with Calculation

The memory representation of the stack-based solution for the regular bracket sequence problem depends on the size of the input string and the number of opening brackets encountered. The space complexity is proportional to the length of the input string.

## Memory Allocation

Memory allocation for the stack-based solution is automatically handled by the C++ memory management system. The stack dynamically allocates memory as elements are pushed and popped.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is not applicable for the stack-based solution as it uses stack memory that is automatically managed by the C++ memory management system.

## Limitations of Stack Using Regular Bracket Sequence Problem Solve

Some limitations of the stack-based solution for the regular bracket sequence problem include:

- Limited to validating regular bracket sequences and not applicable to other types of sequences.
- Requires additional space for the stack, which may impact memory usage for large input strings.
