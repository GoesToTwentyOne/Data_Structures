## Introduction

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the unsorted list into smaller sublists, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back to obtain a sorted list. It is known for its efficiency and stability.

This README file provides an overview of Merge Sort, its working mechanism, complexity analysis, and other relevant details to help you understand and contribute to this project.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

```Let's consider an example to understand how merge sort works. Suppose we have an array of numbers: [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]. Here are the steps taken by merge sort to sort this array:

1. Divide the array into two subarrays: [5, 2, 4] and [6, 1, 3].
2. Recursively apply merge sort on each subarray.
3. Divide [5, 2, 4] into [5] and [2, 4]. Divide [6, 1, 3] into [6] and [1, 3].
4. Recursively sort the subarrays: [5], [2, 4], [6], [1, 3].
5. Merge the sorted subarrays. Merge [5] and [2, 4] to obtain [2, 4, 5]. Merge [6] and [1, 3] to obtain [1, 3, 6].
6. Merge the two final subarrays [2, 4, 5] and [1, 3, 6] to obtain the sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
```

## Why Learn Merge Sort?

Learning Merge Sort can be beneficial for the following reasons:

- Efficiency: Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm with a guaranteed time complexity of O(n log n). It performs well even for large datasets.
- Stability: Merge Sort preserves the relative order of equal elements, making it a stable sorting algorithm.
- Divide-and-Conquer: Understanding the divide-and-conquer paradigm used in Merge Sort helps in solving other complex problems.
- Real-world applications: Merge Sort is utilized in various applications, such as external sorting, database management systems, and parallel computing.

## Real-life Example

Merge Sort finds applications in various real-life scenarios, such as:

**TODO:** Provide a real-life example where Merge Sort could be applied effectively.

## How Merge Sort Works

Merge Sort operates by following these steps:

1. Divide: The unsorted list is divided into smaller sublists recursively until each sublist contains a single element or is empty.
2. Conquer: The sublists are sorted independently using Merge Sort.
3. Combine: The sorted sublists are merged back together repeatedly to produce a single sorted list.

This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

## Complexity Analysis

The complexity analysis of Merge Sort is as follows:

- Time Complexity: Merge Sort has a consistent time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases. It performs equally well in the best, average, and worst cases. The division of the list into smaller sublists takes O(log n) time, and the merging process requires O(n) time. Overall, the time complexity is O(n log n).
- Space Complexity: Merge Sort requires additional space proportional to the size of the input list. This is due to the need to create temporary arrays during the merging process. The space complexity of Merge Sort is O(n).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of using Merge Sort include:

- Stable Sorting: Merge Sort preserves the relative order of equal elements, making it a stable sorting algorithm.
- Efficiency: Merge Sort has a consistent time complexity of O(n log n) and performs well for large datasets.
- Parallelization Potential: Merge Sort can be easily parallelized

, allowing for efficient sorting in parallel computing environments.

Disadvantages of using Merge Sort include:

- Space Complexity: Merge Sort requires additional space proportional to the size of the input list due to the merging process. This can be a limitation for sorting very large datasets.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for Merge Sort can be summarized as follows:

1. If the list contains zero or one element, it is already sorted. Return the list.
2. Divide the unsorted list into two sublists of approximately equal size.
3. Recursively sort the sublists by calling Merge Sort on each sublist.
4. Merge the two sorted sublists back together to obtain a sorted list.

## Pseudocode

Here is the pseudocode for Merge Sort:

```
function mergeSort(list):
    if length of list <= 1:
        return list

    mid = length of list // 2
    left = mergeSort(first half of list)
    right = mergeSort(second half of list)

    return merge(left, right)

function merge(left, right):
    result = empty list

    while left is not empty and right is not empty:
        if first element of left <= first element of right:
            append first element of left to result
            remove first element from left
        else:
            append first element of right to result
            remove first element from right

    append remaining elements of left to result
    append remaining elements of right to result

    return result
```

## Memory Representation and Allocation

Merge Sort works by recursively dividing the input list into smaller sublists until reaching the base case of single-element sublists. During the merging process, temporary arrays are used to store the sorted sublists.

The memory representation and allocation in Merge Sort involve creating temporary arrays during the merging phase. These arrays are allocated and deallocated dynamically based on the size of the input list. The original input list remains intact throughout the sorting process.

## Limitations of Merge Sort

Some limitations of Merge Sort include:

- Space Complexity: Merge Sort requires additional space proportional to the size of the input list due to the merging process. This can be a limitation for sorting very large datasets.
- Recursive Nature: Merge Sort heavily relies on recursion, which may lead to stack overflow errors if the input list size is extremely large.
