# HEAP Data Structure

This is a README file for the HEAP data structure. It provides an introduction to the concept, explains its working principles, complexity analysis, advantages and disadvantages, and includes examples and visualizations to help you understand it better.
## Formula/key node

When working with a HEAP data structure, you can use the following index calculations to navigate through the elements:

- The index of the left child of element at index `i` is `2*i + 1`.
- The index of the right child of element at index `i` is `2*i + 2`.
- The index of the parent of element at index `i` is `(i - 1) / 2` (integer division).

To insert elements into the HEAP, you follow a Breadth-First Search (BFS) order. Starting from the root (index 0), you fill each level from left to right before moving to the next level. This ensures that the HEAP maintains its complete binary tree property.

After inserting an element, you perform an "up-heapify" operation. This operation involves comparing the newly inserted element with its parent and swapping them if necessary to maintain the heap property (e.g., greater than or equal to for max heap).

By applying these calculations and operations, you can construct a HEAP data structure in a readable and precise manner, ensuring efficient insertion and maintenance of the heap property.
```
ith index->
    left child=2*i+1
    right child=2*i-1
    parent=i-1/2

    insert order=BFS
    then up heapify
```

## Introduction

The HEAP data structure is a specialized tree-based data structure commonly used to represent a priority queue. It is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to its children (in a max heap) or less than or equal to its children (in a min heap). The HEAP provides efficient access to the maximum (or minimum) element in constant time and supports operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

Here is an example to demonstrate the HEAP data structure:

```
// TODO: Insert simulation example with visualization
```

## Why Should You Learn It?

Learning about the HEAP data structure is beneficial because:

- It is widely used in various applications and algorithms.
- Understanding HEAPs helps improve your problem-solving skills.
- It provides an efficient way to manage and organize data with prioritization.
- Many programming languages and libraries utilize HEAPs, making it essential knowledge for software development.

## Real-Life Example

One real-life example where HEAP data structure is applied is in job scheduling. Consider a system that needs to schedule tasks based on their priorities. The HEAP data structure can efficiently store the tasks with their priorities and allow the system to select the highest priority task for execution.

## How It Works

In a max heap, the maximum value is always stored at the root of the tree, and each node's value is greater than or equal to its children. In a min heap, the minimum value is stored at the root, and each node's value is less than or equal to its children.

When inserting an element into a HEAP, it is placed at the next available position in the tree and then "bubbled up" by swapping it with its parent if necessary until the heap property is restored. Deleting the maximum (or minimum) element involves swapping it with the last element, removing it, and then "bubbling down" the new root to its correct position.

## Complexity Analysis

The complexity of common operations in a HEAP data structure is as follows:

- Insertion: O(log n)
- Deletion: O(log n)
- Retrieval of maximum/minimum element: O(1)

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of using HEAP data structure:

- Efficient retrieval of the maximum or minimum element

.
- Simple implementation using an array or linked list.
- Suitable for applications requiring priority-based access.

Disadvantages of using HEAP data structure:

- Complex to maintain the heap property during insertion and deletion.
- Additional memory overhead due to tree structure.
- Not suitable for operations requiring sorted data.

## Algorithm

The main algorithm for maintaining the heap property in a HEAP data structure involves comparing and swapping elements to ensure the parent-child relationship satisfies the required condition (e.g., greater than or equal to for max heap).

## Sudo Code

Here's an example of the sudo code for inserting an element into a max heap:

```
// TODO: Insert sudo code example
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

The memory representation of a HEAP data structure can be done using an array or linked list. The index of each element in the array can be calculated based on its position in the binary tree.

## Memory Allocation

The memory allocation for a HEAP data structure can be dynamic, allowing for the addition and removal of elements as needed. The underlying data structure dynamically adjusts its size to accommodate the elements.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is not specifically associated with the HEAP data structure itself. However, if the HEAP uses dynamic memory allocation, the programming language or environment's garbage collector may be responsible for reclaiming the memory occupied by deleted elements.

## Limitation of HEAP Data Structure

Some limitations of the HEAP data structure include:

- HEAPs are not suitable for operations requiring sorted data.
- Insertion and deletion operations have a logarithmic time complexity, which may be slower compared to other data structures for certain use cases.
- Maintaining the heap property during modifications can be complex and time-consuming.
