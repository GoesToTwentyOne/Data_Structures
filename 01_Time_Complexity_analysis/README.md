# Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of instructions used to solve a problem. Algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, from programming languages to search engines, and they can range from simple to complex.

## Algorithm Judging Factors

When judging an algorithm, there are two main factors to consider: time and memory/space. 

### Time

The time complexity of an algorithm is how long it takes for the algorithm to complete, which is usually measured in terms of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) will take longer to complete with a larger input size, while an algorithm with a time complexity of O(1) will take the same amount of time regardless of the input size.

### Memory/Space

The memory/space complexity of an algorithm is how much memory/space is needed to complete the algorithm. This is usually measured in terms of the input size as well. The amount of memory/space needed to complete an algorithm will depend on the type of algorithm and the data structures used.

## Algorithm Time Complexity Notation

There are several notations used to measure the time complexity of an algorithm, including Big O notation, Omega notation, and Theta notation.

* **Big O notation** (O(complexity)) is used to denote the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity.
* **Omega notation** (OMEGA(complexity)) is used to denote the lower bound of an algorithm's time complexity.
* **Theta notation** (Theta(complexity)) is used to denote both the upper and lower bounds of an algorithm's time complexity.

## Big O-notation Symbols

* O(1): Constant number of operations
* O(n): Order n operations
* O(n2): Order of n2
* O(n3): Order of n3
* O(nk): Order of nk (k=1,2,3,4, etc.)
* O(log n): Order of log n
* O(n log n): Order of n log n
* O(n root n): Order of n root n
* O(2n): Order of 2n
* O(cn): Order of cn (c+1,2,3,4, etc.)

## Rules of Thumb

It is estimated that 1 second can process approximately 109 simple operations. This can be used as an approximate estimate for the time complexity of an algorithm.
