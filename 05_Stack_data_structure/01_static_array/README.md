**Stack Using Static Array**
- This repository provides an implementation of a stack data structure using a static array. It includes a simulation with examples, real-life use cases, an explanation of how it works, complexity analysis for all operations, advantages and disadvantages, algorithm, pseudo code, memory representation with calculations, memory allocation, garbage collection, and limitations of a stack using a static array.

**Simulation with Example**
- Suppose we have a stack with a maximum capacity of N elements. Here's an example of how the stack operates:

- Stack: []

- Push(5)
- Stack: [5]

- Push(10)
- Stack: [5, 10]

- Push(15)
- Stack: [5, 10, 15]

- Pop()
- Stack: [5, 10]

- Top()
- Output: 10

- IsEmpty()
- Output: False

- Size()
- Output: 2


**Real-life Example**
- A real-life example of a stack using a static array can be seen in the call stack of a programming language. The call stack keeps track of function calls and their return addresses during program execution. Each function call pushes its information onto the stack, and when the function returns, the information is popped from the stack.

**How It Works**
- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The implementation using a static array involves the following operations:

- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
- Top: Returns the top element without removing it.
- IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
- Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- The static array used to represent the stack has a fixed size N, and the stack starts empty. The top of the stack is represented by a variable that keeps track of the index of the last inserted element.

**Complexity Analysis**
- The complexity analysis for stack operations using a static array is as follows:

- Push: O(1) - Constant time complexity.
- Pop: O(1) - Constant time complexity.
- Top: O(1) - Constant time complexity.
- IsEmpty: O(1) - Constant time complexity.
- Size: O(1) - Constant time complexity.

**Advantage and Disadvantage**
- Advantages of using a stack with a static array:

- Simple implementation.
- Constant time complexity for all operations.
- No dynamic memory allocation required.

**Disadvantages of using a stack with a static array:**

- Limited capacity due to the fixed size of the array.
- Wasted memory if the stack does not reach its maximum capacity.

**Algorithm**
- The algorithm for implementing a stack using a static array is as follows:

- Create a static array of size N to represent the stack.
- Initialize a variable top to -1 to indicate an empty stack.
- Implement the stack operations using the array and top variable.


**Pseudo Code**
- Here's the pseudo code for the stack operations:

- Stack:
  - array[N]
  - top = -1

- Push(element):
  - if top equals N-1:
    - return "Stack Overflow"
  - top = top + 1
  - array[top] = element

- Pop():
  - if IsEmpty():
    - return "Stack Underflow"
  - element = array[top]
  - top = top - 1
  - return element

- Top():
  - if IsEmpty():
    - return "Stack is empty"
  - return array[top]

- IsEmpty():
  - return top equals -1

- Size():
  - return top + 1


**Memory Representation with Calculation**
- The memory representation of a stack using a static array involves calculating the required memory based on the number of elements (N) and their data type. Assuming each element requires M bytes of memory, the total memory required is N * M.

**Memory Allocation**
- Since the stack uses a static array, the memory allocation is done during compile-time. The array is allocated with a fixed size N determined beforehand.

**Garbage Collection**
- Garbage collection is not applicable in a stack using a static array since the memory allocation is fixed and managed by the compiler or runtime environment.

**Limitations of Stack Using Static Array**
- Some limitations of using a stack with a static array include:

- Limited capacity: The stack size is fixed and cannot dynamically grow beyond the array's capacity.
Wasted memory: If the stack does not reach its maximum capacity, the remaining memory allocated to the array remains unused.
- No automatic resizing: When the stack reaches its maximum capacity, no automatic resizing is possible without creating a new stack and copying the elements.
