## Introduction

Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It repeatedly takes the next element from the unsorted portion of the array and inserts it into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

This README file provides an overview of Insertion Sort, its working mechanism, complexity analysis, and other relevant details to help you understand and contribute to this project.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

```
Let's consider an example to understand how insertion sort works. Suppose we have an array of numbers: [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]. Here are the steps taken by insertion sort to sort this array:

1. Start with the second element (2) and compare it with the first element (5). Since 2 is smaller, swap their positions. The array becomes [2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 3].
2. Move to the third element (4) and compare it with the second element (5). Since 4 is smaller, swap their positions. The array becomes [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3].
3. Move to the fourth element (6) and compare it with the third element (5). Since 6 is greater, no swap is needed. The array remains [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3].
4. Move to the fifth element (1) and compare it with the fourth element (6). Since 1 is smaller, swap their positions. The array becomes [2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 3].
5. Move to the sixth element (3) and compare it with the fifth element (6). Since 3 is smaller, swap their positions. The array becomes [2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6].
6. Repeat the above steps until all elements are in their correct positions. The sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
```

## Why Learn Insertion Sort?

Learning Insertion Sort can be beneficial for the following reasons:

- Simplicity: Insertion Sort is relatively easy to understand and implement. It serves as a good starting point for learning sorting algorithms before diving into more complex ones.
- Educational purposes: Insertion Sort is often taught in computer science courses as an introductory sorting algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness for small datasets.
- Application in practice: Although not the most efficient algorithm for large datasets, Insertion Sort can still be useful in certain scenarios, such as when dealing with small or nearly sorted arrays.
- Algorithmic analysis: Studying the time and space complexity of Insertion Sort helps develop skills in algorithm analysis and comparison with other sorting algorithms.

## Real-life Example

Insertion Sort finds applications in various real-life scenarios, such as:

**TODO:** Provide a real-life example where Insertion Sort could be applied effectively.

## How Insertion Sort Works

Insertion Sort works by iteratively considering one element at a time from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

The algorithm maintains a "sorted" region on the left side of the array, where elements are in their final sorted order. It begins with the second element (index 1) and compares it with the preceding elements in the sorted region. If the current element is smaller, it is inserted into the correct position by shifting the larger elements to the right.

This process continues until the last element is considered, resulting in a fully sorted array.

## Complexity Analysis

The complexity analysis of Insertion Sort is as follows:

- Time Complexity: The worst-case and average time complexity of Insertion Sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. In the worst case, when the array is in reverse order, each element needs to be compared and shifted to the beginning of the sorted region. However, the best-case time complexity is O(n) when the array is already sorted or nearly sorted.
- Space Complexity: Insertion Sort has a space

 complexity of O(1) since it does not require any additional data structures and operates in-place.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of using Insertion Sort include:

- Simplicity: Insertion Sort is easy to understand and implement.
- Space Efficiency: It operates in-place, requiring minimal additional memory.

Disadvantages of using Insertion Sort include:

- Inefficiency for large datasets: Insertion Sort's quadratic time complexity makes it inefficient for sorting large datasets. Other algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort are generally preferred for larger lists.
- Lack of adaptability: Insertion Sort does not adapt to the initial order of the elements. It performs the same number of comparisons and shifts regardless of the input's initial order.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for Insertion Sort can be summarized as follows:

1. Start with the second element (index 1) and iterate through the array.
2. Compare the current element with the elements to its left in the sorted region.
3. If the current element is smaller, shift the larger elements to the right to create space for insertion.
4. Insert the current element into its correct position within the sorted region.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire array is sorted.

## Pseudocode

Here is the pseudocode for Insertion Sort:

```
function insertionSort(array):
    n = length of array
    for i from 1 to n-1:
        key = array[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and array[j] > key:
            array[j+1] = array[j]
            j = j - 1
        array[j+1] = key
    return array
```

## Memory Representation and Allocation

Insertion Sort operates directly on the elements within the array and does not require any additional memory allocation beyond the existing array. It swaps and shifts elements in-place to sort the array. Therefore, the memory representation remains the same as the input array, and no extra memory allocation is needed.

## Limitations of Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort has several limitations, including:

- Inefficiency for large datasets: Insertion Sort's quadratic time complexity makes it inefficient for sorting large datasets. Other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort are generally preferred for larger lists.
- Lack of adaptability: Insertion Sort does not adapt to the initial order of the elements. It performs the same number of comparisons and shifts regardless of the input's initial order.
- Slow convergence: Insertion Sort may require multiple comparisons and shifts even if the array is already sorted or nearly sorted. This can result in unnecessary computational overhead.
