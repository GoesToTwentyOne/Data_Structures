## Simulation with Example and Visualization

To better understand the Deque operations, let's simulate an example and visualize the actions performed on the Deque.

```cpp
// TODO: Include necessary headers and namespaces

int main() {
    // Create an instance of Deque using a specific data type
    Deque<int> deque;

    // Push elements from the front and back
    deque.push_front(10);
    deque.push_back(20);
    deque.push_front(30);
    deque.push_back(40);

    // Visualize the current state of the Deque
    deque.visualize();

    // Perform other operations such as popping elements, getting front/back, etc.

    return 0;
}
```

Visualization:
```
Initially, the Deque is empty:
Deque: []

Pushing elements 10, 20 from front and 30, 40 from back:
Deque: [30, 10, 20, 40]

// Visualize other operations as well
```

## Why Should You Learn It?

Learning the Deque using a doubly linked list with generic programming offers several advantages:

- **Code Reusability:** The template class allows you to use the Deque with different data types without duplicating code, promoting code reusability and reducing development time.
- **Flexibility:** The Deque data structure provides efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends, offering flexibility in solving a wide range of problems.
- **Generic Programming:** Understanding and utilizing generic programming concepts enhance your programming skills and enable you to create versatile and reusable code.

By mastering this implementation, you gain a valuable tool that can be applied to various real-world scenarios and improve your software development capabilities.

## Real-life Example

A real-life example where the Deque using a doubly linked list with generic programming can be beneficial is in the implementation of a task scheduler. In a task scheduler, multiple tasks with different priorities need to be managed and executed based on their importance. The Deque allows efficient insertion and removal of tasks at both ends, enabling the scheduler to prioritize and execute tasks effectively.

## How It Works

The Deque using a doubly linked list with generic programming maintains two pointers: a front pointer and a rear pointer. The front pointer represents the

 head of the deque, while the rear pointer represents the tail.

Each node in the doubly linked list contains the following components:
- Data: Holds the value of the element being stored.
- Prev: A pointer that references the previous node.
- Next: A pointer that references the next node.

The Deque operations, such as `push_front`, `push_back`, `pop_front`, `pop_back`, `get_front`, and `get_back`, are implemented using these pointers and the necessary connections between nodes.

## Complexity Analysis for All Operations

The complexity analysis for the Deque operations implemented using a doubly linked list is as follows:

- `push_front`: O(1)
- `push_back`: O(1)
- `pop_front`: O(1)
- `pop_back`: O(1)
- `get_front`: O(1)
- `get_back`: O(1)
- `is_empty`: O(1)

The operations have constant time complexity, making the Deque efficient for handling elements at both ends.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of the Deque using a doubly linked list with generic programming include:

- Supports efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.
- Allows seamless handling of different data types using generic programming.
- Enables code reusability and flexibility.

Disadvantages of this implementation include:

- Increased memory usage due to the additional pointers in each node compared to simpler data structures.
- Slower random access compared to array-based data structures.

## Algorithm and Pseudocode

The algorithm for the Deque using a doubly linked list involves the following operations:

- `push_front(data)`: Inserts an element at the front of the deque.
- `push_back(data)`: Inserts an element at the back of the deque.
- `pop_front()`: Removes and returns the element from the front of the deque.
- `pop_back()`: Removes and returns the element from the back of the deque.
- `get_front()`: Returns the element at the front of the deque.
- `get_back()`: Returns the element at the back of the deque.
- `is_empty()`: Checks if the deque is empty.

Here's the pseudocode representation of the algorithm:

```plaintext
Deque using Doubly Linked List (Template Class: Generic Programming):

Node:
  data
  prev
  next

Deque:
  front
  rear

is_empty():
  return front is None

push_front(data):
  new_node = Node(data)
  if is_empty():
    front = rear = new_node
  else:
    new_node.next = front
    front.prev = new_node
    front = new_node

push_back(data):
  new_node = Node(data)
  if is_empty():
    front = rear = new_node
  else:
    rear.next = new_node
    new_node.prev = rear
    rear = new_node

pop_front():
  if is_empty():
    return None
  data = front.data
  if front == rear:
    front = rear = None
  else:
    front = front.next
    front.prev = None
  return data

pop_back():
  if is_empty():
    return None
  data = rear.data
  if front == rear:
    front = rear = None
  else:
    rear = rear.prev
    rear.next = None
  return data

get_front():
  return front.data if front else None

get_back():
  return rear.data if rear else None
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

In the Deque using a doubly linked list with generic programming, each node consists of three components:
- Data: Holds the value of the element being stored.
- Prev: A pointer that references the previous node.
- Next: A

 pointer that references the next node.

Considering an example where the data type is `int`, each node requires the following memory:

- Data (int): 4 bytes
- Prev (pointer): 4 bytes
- Next (pointer): 4 bytes

Therefore, the total memory required for each node is 12 bytes.

## Memory Allocation and Garbage Collection

Memory allocation for the nodes in the doubly linked list is done dynamically. Each time a new element is pushed into the deque, memory is allocated to create a new node to store the data.

Garbage collection, either manual or automatic, is responsible for reclaiming memory that is no longer in use. When nodes are removed from the deque, the memory associated with those nodes can be freed up by the garbage collector.

## Limitations of Deque using Doubly Linked List (Template Class: Generic Programming)

The Deque using a doubly linked list with generic programming has the following limitations:

- Increased Memory Usage: The doubly linked list implementation requires additional memory to store the prev and next pointers in each node. This can result in increased memory consumption compared to simpler data structures like arrays.

- Slower Random Access: Unlike array-based deque implementations, accessing elements at arbitrary positions in a doubly linked list is slower. Traversing the list to reach a specific index takes linear time, resulting in slower random access operations.

- Complexity of Implementation: Implementing a doubly linked list-based deque with generic programming involves more complex code compared to other simpler data structures. Handling the connections between nodes and updating pointers correctly requires careful attention.
