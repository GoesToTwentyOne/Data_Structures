# Sorting Stack using Another Temporary Stack

This repository provides an implementation of a stack data structure in C++ that can be used to sort the elements in the stack using another temporary stack.

## Introduction

The sorting stack implementation allows you to sort the elements in a stack in ascending order using an auxiliary stack. It utilizes the stack data structure and the concept of temporary storage to achieve the sorting functionality.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

Here's an example of how to use the sorting stack implementation:

```cpp
STACK<int> st;
st.push(2);
st.push(3);
st.push(5);
st.push(4);
st.push(1);
st.push(10);
st.push(6);

STACK<int> temp;

while (st.getSize() > 0) {
  int t = st.top();
  st.pop();

  while (temp.getSize() > 0) {
    if (temp.top() < t) {
      break;
    }
    st.push(temp.top());
    temp.pop();
  }

  temp.push(t);
}

// Swap the contents of 'st' and 'temp' stacks
swap(st, temp);

while (st.getSize() > 0) {
  cout << st.dl.top() << '\n';
  st.pop();
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how the sorting stack implementation works by using an auxiliary stack, `temp`, to sort the elements in the original stack, `st`. The sorted elements are then printed in ascending order.

## Why You Should Learn It?

Understanding how to sort a stack using another temporary stack is beneficial because:

- It helps you understand the stack data structure and its properties.
- Sorting a stack is a common problem in computer science interviews and coding challenges.
- It enhances your problem-solving skills and logical thinking.
- It introduces the concept of using auxiliary data structures to achieve desired functionalities.

## Real-life Example

Sorting a stack using another temporary stack can be applied to various real-life scenarios. For example:

- Organizing a stack of books based on their heights.
- Sorting a stack of documents based on their timestamps.
- Arranging a stack of cards in a card game.

In all these scenarios, sorting the stack allows for easier access to the items in a specific order.

## How It Works

The sorting stack implementation works by using an auxiliary stack to temporarily store elements during the sorting process. The algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Create two stacks: the original stack (`st`) and the temporary stack (`temp`).
2. While the original stack is not empty, take the top element (`t`) from the original stack.
3.

 Compare `t` with the top element of the temporary stack (`temp.top()`).
4. If `t` is greater than the top element of `temp`, push it onto the temporary stack.
5. If `t` is smaller than or equal to the top element of `temp`, move elements from `temp` to `st` until a suitable position is found for `t`.
6. Push `t` onto `temp`.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the original stack becomes empty.
8. Swap the contents of the original stack (`st`) and the temporary stack (`temp`).
9. The elements in `st` are now sorted in ascending order.

## Complexity Analysis for All Operations

The complexity analysis for the sorting stack implementation is as follows:

- **Push Operation**: O(1)
- **Pop Operation**: O(1)
- **Top Operation**: O(1)
- **Sorting Operation**: O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the stack. The worst-case complexity occurs when the elements are in reverse order initially.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of the sorting stack implementation:

- Simple and intuitive approach to sort elements in a stack.
- Utilizes the stack data structure efficiently.

Disadvantages of the sorting stack implementation:

- The worst-case time complexity of the sorting operation is relatively high (O(n^2)).
- Requires additional space for the temporary stack.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for sorting a stack using another temporary stack can be summarized as follows:

1. Create two stacks: the original stack (`st`) and the temporary stack (`temp`).
2. While the original stack is not empty, do the following:
   - Take the top element (`t`) from the original stack.
   - While the temporary stack is not empty and the top element of the temporary stack is greater than `t`, do the following:
     - Pop the top element from the temporary stack and push it onto the original stack.
   - Push `t` onto the temporary stack.
3. Swap the contents of the original stack and the temporary stack.
4. The elements in the original stack are now sorted in ascending order.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
SortingStack(stack):
    Create an empty temporary stack
    while stack is not empty:
        t = top element of stack
        while temporary stack is not empty and top element of temporary stack is greater than t:
            Pop the top element from temporary stack and push it onto stack
        Push t onto temporary stack
    Swap the contents of stack and temporary stack
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

The memory representation of the sorting stack implementation involves the following components:

- Two stacks: the original stack (`st`) and the temporary stack (`temp`).
- Each stack node (`NODE`) containing:
  - Data: the value of the element stored in the node.
  - Next pointer: points to the next node in the stack.
  - Previous pointer: points to the previous node in the stack.

The memory required for the stack nodes can be calculated based on the number of elements in the stack.

## Memory Allocation

Memory allocation for the sorting stack implementation is dynamic and handled by the underlying data structures, such as linked lists or arrays. Each new node created for the stacks is dynamically allocated using the `new` keyword in C++.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection in the sorting stack implementation is automatically handled by the C++ memory management system. When a node is deleted or becomes unreachable, the memory is automatically freed and made available for reuse.

## Limitations of Sorting Stack with Another Temporary Stack

- The sorting operation has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), which may not be efficient

 for large stacks.
- The implementation requires additional space for the temporary stack, which increases the memory usage.
- The approach is not suitable for sorting stacks with complex data structures or objects that require custom comparison functions.
