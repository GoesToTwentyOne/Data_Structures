## Introduction

Quick Sort is a highly efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It is widely used due to its speed and versatility.

This README file provides an overview of Quick Sort, its working mechanism, complexity analysis, and other relevant details to help you understand and contribute to this project.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

```Let's understand how Quick Sort works with an example:

Suppose we have an array of integers: [7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]. Applying Quick Sort on this array involves the following steps:

1. Choose a pivot element from the array. In this example, let's choose the last element, 4, as the pivot.
2. Partition the array by rearranging its elements such that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. After the partitioning step, the array may look like: [2, 1, 3, 4, 8, 5, 7, 6].
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarrays on the left and right of the pivot until the entire array is sorted.
4. The sorted array will be: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
```


## Why Learn Quick Sort?

Learning Quick Sort can be beneficial for the following reasons:

- Efficiency: Quick Sort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms in practice. It has an average time complexity of O(n log n), making it suitable for large datasets.
- In-place Sorting: Quick Sort performs sorting in-place, meaning it doesn't require additional memory beyond the input array. This makes it memory-efficient.
- Versatility: Quick Sort can be used to sort arrays of various data types and handle different scenarios.
- Understanding Divide-and-Conquer: Quick Sort employs the divide-and-conquer approach, which is essential for solving many other complex problems.

## Real-life Example

Quick Sort finds applications in various real-life scenarios, such as:

**TODO:** Provide a real-life example where Quick Sort could be applied effectively.

## How Quick Sort Works

Quick Sort operates by following these steps:

1. Choose a pivot element from the array. The choice of the pivot can vary, but a common approach is to select the rightmost element.
2. Partition the array into two subarrays: one with elements smaller than the pivot and another with elements greater than the pivot.
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

The partitioning step plays a crucial role in the efficiency of Quick Sort. It rearranges the elements such that all elements smaller than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it.

## Complexity Analysis

The complexity analysis of Quick Sort is as follows:

- Time Complexity: Quick Sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n). However, in the worst case, when the pivot is consistently chosen poorly, the time complexity can degrade to O(n^2). Despite this, Quick Sort is often faster than other sorting algorithms in practice due to its efficient partitioning and recursive nature.
- Space Complexity: Quick Sort has a space complexity of O(log n) for the recursive calls. The additional space required is primarily for the function call stack.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of using Quick Sort include:

- Efficiency: Quick Sort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms in practice. It performs well on average, making it suitable for a wide

 range of applications.
- In-place Sorting: Quick Sort operates in-place, meaning it doesn't require additional memory beyond the input array. This makes it memory-efficient.

Disadvantages of using Quick Sort include:

- Worst-case Performance: Quick Sort's worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which occurs when the pivot selection is consistently poor. However, various techniques, like randomized pivot selection, can mitigate this issue.

## Algorithm

The Quick Sort algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Choose a pivot element from the array.
2. Partition the array into two subarrays: one with elements smaller than the pivot and another with elements greater than the pivot.
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

## Pseudocode

The pseudocode for Quick Sort is as follows:

```
function quickSort(array):
    if length of array <= 1:
        return array

    pivot = choosePivot(array)
    smaller = []
    equal = []
    greater = []

    for element in array:
        if element < pivot:
            append element to smaller
        else if element > pivot:
            append element to greater
        else:
            append element to equal

    return concatenate(quickSort(smaller), equal, quickSort(greater))

function choosePivot(array):
    return rightmost element of array
```

## Memory Representation and Allocation

Quick Sort operates by recursively dividing the input array into subarrays. The memory representation involves creating smaller subarrays during the partitioning step.

During the partitioning process, elements are moved within the original array, and additional space is not allocated. Quick Sort utilizes the memory of the input array to perform the sorting.

## Limitations of Quick Sort

Some limitations of Quick Sort include:

- Worst-case Performance: In the worst-case scenario, Quick Sort can have a time complexity of O(n^2) if the pivot selection is consistently poor. Randomized pivot selection or other techniques can help mitigate this issue.
- Recursive Nature: Quick Sort heavily relies on recursion. With a large number of recursive calls, it may lead to stack overflow errors.
