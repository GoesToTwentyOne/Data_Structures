# Doubly Linked List Stack Implementation with Sorting

This is a C++ code implementation of a stack using a doubly linked list, along with a sorting algorithm to sort the elements in ascending order. The code provides an efficient way to perform stack operations and sort the stack using insertion sort.

## Visual Representation

Here is a visual representation of the stack and sorting process:

Initial Stack:
```
      +---+
top-->| 6 |
      +---+
      | 10|
      +---+
      | 1 |
      +---+
      | 4 |
      +---+
      | 5 |
      +---+
      | 3 |
      +---+
      | 2 |
      +---+
```

Sorted Stack:
```
      +---+
top-->| 1 |
      +---+
      | 2 |
      +---+
      | 3 |
      +---+
      | 4 |
      +---+
      | 5 |
      +---+
      | 6 |
      +---+
      |10 |
      +---+
```

## How to Use

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary headers and templates.
2. Create a `STACK` object, e.g., `STACK<int> st;`.
3. Perform stack operations using `push`, `pop`, and `top` functions.
4. To sort the stack, use the provided sorting algorithm by creating a temporary stack and applying insertion sort.
5. Print the sorted stack elements.

Here's an example usage of the code:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
// Include necessary headers and templates

int main() {
  // Create a STACK object
  STACK<int> st;

  // Push elements into the stack
  st.push(2);
  st.push(3);
  st.push(5);
  st.push(4);
  st.push(1);
  st.push(10);
  st.push(6);

  // Sort the stack
  STACK<int> temp;
  while (st.getSize() > 0) {
    int t = st.top();
    st.pop();
    while (temp.getSize() > 0 && temp.top() < t) {
      st.push(temp.top());
      temp.pop();
    }
    temp.push(t);
  }
  swap(st, temp);

  // Print the sorted stack elements
  while (st.getSize() > 0) {
    cout << st.dl.top() << '\n';
    st.pop();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Make sure to replace the `cout` statement with the appropriate output mechanism for your desired environment.

Feel free to modify the code as needed and explore different use cases.

Enjoy coding!
