Sure! Here's a README.md file that provides an overview of different sorting algorithms:

# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains various sorting algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Each algorithm comes with a simulation with examples, real-life examples, information on how it works, complexity analysis, advantages, disadvantages, algorithm details, pseudocode, memory representation and calculation, memory allocation, garbage collection, and limitations.

## Algorithms Included

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Radix Sort
8. Counting Sort
9. Bucket Sort

## Contents

Each sorting algorithm is explained in a separate markdown file:

1. `bubble_sort.md`
2. `selection_sort.md`
3. `insertion_sort.md`
4. `merge_sort.md`
5. `quick_sort.md`
6. `heap_sort.md`
7. `radix_sort.md`
8. `counting_sort.md`
9. `bucket_sort.md`
