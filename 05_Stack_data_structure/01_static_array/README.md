## Simulation with Example and Visualization
To better understand the stack using a static array, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a stack that can store integers. We can perform operations such as push (adding an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removing the top element from the stack). Here's a visual representation of the stack:

```
|         |
|    30   |
|    20   |
|    10   |
|_________|
```

## Simulation with Example and Visualization of All Operations
Let's simulate and visualize all the stack operations using a static array:

1. Initial Stack:
   ```
   |         |
   |         |
   |         |
   |         |
   |_________|
   ```

2. Push 10:
   ```
   |         |
   |         |
   |         |
   |    10   |
   |_________|
   ```

3. Push 20:
   ```
   |         |
   |         |
   |    20   |
   |    10   |
   |_________|
   ```

4. Push 30:
   ```
   |         |
   |    30   |
   |    20   |
   |    10   |
   |_________|
   ```

5. Pop Operation (returns 30):
   ```
   |         |
   |         |
   |    20   |
   |    10   |
   |_________|
   ```

6. Pop Operation (returns 20):
   ```
   |         |
   |         |
   |         |
   |    10   |
   |_________|
   ```

7. Pop Operation (returns 10):
   ```
   |         |
   |         |
   |         |
   |         |
   |_________|
   ```

## Why You Should Learn It?
Learning how to implement a stack using a static array has several benefits

:
- Stack is a fundamental data structure used in many algorithms and applications.
- Understanding stack helps in solving problems related to recursive function calls, expression evaluation, backtracking, and more.
- It enhances your understanding of memory management and data organization.

## Real-Life Example
A real-life example of a stack can be seen in web browsers' back and forward buttons. The URLs you visit are stored in a stack-like manner, allowing you to navigate back and forth between visited pages.

## How It Works
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. In the context of a static array, a stack is implemented using a fixed-size array where elements are added and removed from one end known as the top. The top of the stack represents the last inserted element, and the bottom represents the first inserted element.

## Complexity Analysis for All Operations
The complexity analysis for stack operations implemented using a static array is as follows:
- Push Operation: O(1)
- Pop Operation: O(1)

## Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages of using a stack implemented with a static array:
- Simple implementation
- Efficient operations (constant time complexity)

Disadvantages of using a stack implemented with a static array:
- Limited size due to the fixed array length
- Wasted memory if the stack is not fully utilized

## Algorithm
The algorithm for implementing a stack using a static array can be summarized as follows:
1. Create an array with a fixed size to hold the elements of the stack.
2. Initialize the top index to -1, indicating an empty stack.
3. Implement the push operation to add elements to the top of the stack.
4. Implement the pop operation to remove and return the top element from the stack.
5. Perform necessary checks for stack overflow and underflow conditions.

## Pseudocode
Here's the pseudocode for implementing a stack using a static array:

```
STACK_SIZE = Maximum size of the stack
stack = Array of size STACK_SIZE
top = -1

function push(element):
    if top == STACK_SIZE - 1:
        print "Stack Overflow"
    else:
        top = top + 1
        stack[top] = element

function pop():
    if top == -1:
        print "Stack Underflow"
    else:
        element = stack[top]
        top = top - 1
        return element
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation
The memory representation of a stack using a static array depends on the size of the array and the number of elements stored in the stack. Each element occupies a fixed amount of memory.

The total memory used by the stack can be calculated as: `Total Memory = Size of each element * Number of elements`.

For example, if the size of each element is 4 bytes and the stack contains 5 elements, the total memory usage would be `4 * 5 = 20 bytes`.

## Memory Allocation
In a stack using a static array, memory allocation is done during the declaration of the array itself. The array size is determined based on the maximum number of elements the stack can hold.

## Garbage Collection
Garbage collection is not directly applicable to a stack implemented using a static array since the array has a fixed size and the elements are managed explicitly. Memory deallocation is not necessary as the array size remains constant.

## Limitation of Stack Using Static Array
A stack implemented using a static array has the following limitations:
- Limited size due to the fixed array length.
- Inefficient memory usage if the stack is not fully utilized.

## Feedback
We welcome any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports for the stack implementation using a static array. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with your

 contributions.
