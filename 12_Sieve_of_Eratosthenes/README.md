**Sieve of Eratosthenes**
- The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number, starting from 2, as composite (not prime).

**Example**
- Let's consider an example to understand how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works. Suppose we want to find all prime numbers up to 30.
- Start with a list of numbers from 2 to 30.
- Mark 2 as prime and cross out all its multiples (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30).
- Move to the next unmarked number, which is 3, and mark it as prime. Cross out all its multiples (6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30).
- Repeat the above step for the next unmarked number, which is 5, and cross out its multiples (10, 15, 20, 25, 30).
- Continue this process until all numbers up to the given limit are processed.
- The remaining unmarked numbers in the list (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29) are the prime numbers up to 30.

**How It Works**
- The algorithm for the Sieve of Eratosthenes can be summarized as follows:
- Create a list of numbers from 2 to the given limit.
- Start with the first number in the list (2) and mark it as prime.
- Cross out all multiples of the current prime number up to the given limit.
- Move to the next unmarked number in the list and repeat steps 2-3.
- Continue this process until all numbers up to the given limit are processed.
- The remaining unmarked numbers in the list are the prime numbers.

**Complexity Analysis**
- The Sieve of Eratosthenes has a time complexity of O(n log log n), where n is the given limit. This is because the algorithm iterates over each number once and crosses out its multiples.

- The space complexity is O(n), as the algorithm requires a list of boolean values to mark the prime and composite numbers.

**Advantages**
- Efficient: The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient methods to find prime numbers up to a given limit.
- Simplicity: The algorithm is relatively simple to understand and implement.
All primes found: The algorithm guarantees that all prime numbers up to the given limit are found.
**Disadvantages**
- Memory Usage: The Sieve of Eratosthenes requires a list of boolean values for marking the prime and composite numbers, which can consume significant memory for large limits.
- Limited by the limit: The algorithm is not suitable for finding prime numbers beyond a specified limit. It can only find primes up to a predetermined value.

**Algorithm**
The algorithm for the Sieve of Eratosthenes can be described as follows:

- Create a boolean array "isPrime[0..limit]" and initialize all entries as true.
- Mark 0 and 1 as false since they are not prime.
- For each number p from 2 to the square root of the limit, do the following:
- If isPrime[p] is true, then it is a prime number.
- Mark all multiples of p as false since they are not prime.
-Print or store the remaining numbers marked as true in the isPrime array as prime numbers.
**Pseudocode**
- Here's a pseudocode representation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:
- function sieveOfEratosthenes(limit):
    - Create a boolean array isPrime[0..limit] and initialize all entries as true

    - Set isPrime[0] and isPrime[1] as false

    - for p = 2 to square root of limit do
        - if isPrime[p] is true then
            - for i = p * p to limit step p do
                - isPrime[i] = false
        - end for
    - end for

    - Print or store the prime numbers from 2 to limit using the isPrime array
- end function
- **Limitations of Sieve of Eratosthenes**
- Memory Usage: The algorithm requires memory proportional to the given limit, which can be a limitation for large limits.
- Not Suitable for Large Primes: The Sieve of Eratosthenes is more suitable for finding small to moderate-sized prime numbers rather than very large prime numbers.
- Limited by the limit: The algorithm can only find prime numbers up to a predetermined value and cannot be used to generate an infinite list of primes.
- It is important to consider the limitations and choose an appropriate algorithm based on the specific requirements of prime number generation or identification.
