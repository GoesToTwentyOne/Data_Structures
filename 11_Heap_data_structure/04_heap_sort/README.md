# Heap Sort

This repository provides an implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm.

It achieves a time complexity of O(n log n), making it an efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets.

## Introduction

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that leverages the Heap data structure to efficiently sort elements. It works by building a max-heap or min-heap from the input array and repeatedly extracting the root (which represents the largest or smallest element) until the array is sorted. Heap Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that offers a good balance between simplicity and performance.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

To illustrate the Heap Sort algorithm, let's consider the following unsorted array:

```
[9, 6, 5, 2, 8]
```

1. Build a max-heap from the given array.
2. Perform the Heap Sort by repeatedly extracting the root (maximum element) and swapping it with the last element in the heap.
3. After each extraction, decrease the heap size and re-heapify to maintain the max-heap property.
4. Repeat the extraction and re-heapify process until the entire array is sorted.

Visualization:

```
Step 1: Build Max-Heap
       9
      / \
     6   5
    / \
   2   8

Step 2: Heap Sort
[9, 6, 5, 2, 8] -> [8, 6, 5, 2, 9]
[8, 6, 5, 2, 9] -> [6, 2, 5, 8, 9]
[6, 2, 5, 8, 9] -> [5, 2, 6, 8, 9]
[5, 2, 6, 8, 9] -> [2, 5, 6, 8, 9]
[2, 5, 6, 8, 9] -> Sorted Array
```

## Why You Should Learn It?

Learning Heap Sort is beneficial for the following reasons:

1. Efficient Sorting: Heap Sort offers a time complexity of O(n log n), making it suitable for sorting large datasets.
2. In-Place Sorting: Heap Sort operates directly on the input array without requiring additional memory, resulting in efficient memory usage.
3. Fundamental Concept: Understanding Heap Sort provides a foundation for understanding other heap-based data structures and algorithms

.

## Real-life Example

A real-life example of Heap Sort is in computer graphics when rendering objects based on their depth or distance from the viewer. Objects can be sorted using Heap Sort based on their Z-coordinate (depth) to determine the order in which they should be rendered, allowing efficient and accurate rendering.

## How It Works

The Heap Sort algorithm follows these steps:

1. Build a max-heap or min-heap from the input array.
2. Perform the Heap Sort by repeatedly extracting the root (maximum or minimum element depending on the heap type) and swapping it with the last element in the heap.
3. After each extraction, decrease the heap size and re-heapify the remaining elements to maintain the heap property.
4. Repeat the extraction and re-heapify process until the entire array is sorted.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of Heap Sort is O(n log n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the input array. This complexity arises from the repeated heapify operation during the sorting process. The space complexity is O(1) since Heap Sort sorts the array in-place without requiring additional memory.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages of Heap Sort:
- Efficient for large datasets due to its O(n log n) time complexity.
- In-place sorting algorithm, reducing memory usage.
- Guarantees sorting stability.

Disadvantages of Heap Sort:
- Slower than some other sorting algorithms for small datasets due to its relatively higher constant factors.
- Not a stable sorting algorithm when using a max-heap.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for Heap Sort can be summarized as follows:

1. Build a max-heap or min-heap from the input array.
2. Perform the Heap Sort by repeatedly extracting the root element and swapping it with the last element in the heap.
3. Decrease the heap size and re-heapify the remaining elements after each extraction.
4. Repeat the extraction and re-heapify process until the entire array is sorted.

## Pseudocode

Here's the pseudocode for Heap Sort:

```
heapSort(array):
    n = length(array)

    // Build max-heap or min-heap
    for i = floor(n/2) - 1 downto 0:
        heapify(array, n, i)

    // Heap Sort
    for i = n - 1 downto 1:
        swap(array[0], array[i])
        heapify(array, i, 0)

heapify(array, n, index):
    largest = index
    leftChild = 2 * index + 1
    rightChild = 2 * index + 2

    if leftChild < n and array[leftChild] > array[largest]:
        largest = leftChild

    if rightChild < n and array[rightChild] > array[largest]:
        largest = rightChild

    if largest != index:
        swap(array[index], array[largest])
        heapify(array, n, largest)
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

Heap Sort operates directly on the input array without allocating additional memory. The memory representation remains the same as the original array.

## Memory Allocation

Memory allocation for the array used in Heap Sort is typically managed by the programming language or runtime environment. When the array is created, the necessary memory is allocated to hold the specified number of elements. The memory allocation and deallocation processes are abstracted from the user, who only interacts with the array through its provided operations.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is a memory management technique used by some programming languages and runtime environments to automatically reclaim memory that is no longer needed. In the context of Heap Sort, garbage collection may be employed if the underlying programming language/runtime supports it. The

 implementation details of garbage collection can vary, but its purpose is to free memory occupied by the original array and any temporary variables used during the sorting process.

## Limitations of Heap Sort

- Not the fastest algorithm for small datasets due to its relatively higher constant factors compared to other sorting algorithms like Insertion Sort or Quick Sort.
- Not a stable sorting algorithm when using a max-heap.
