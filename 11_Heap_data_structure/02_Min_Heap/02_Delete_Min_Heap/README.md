# Delete at Min HEAP

This repository provides an implementation of the "Delete at Min" operation in a Min Heap data structure. The Min Heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the Min Heap property, where the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children. The "Delete at Min" operation removes the minimum element from the heap and maintains the heap property.

## Simulation with Example and Visualization

To demonstrate the "Delete at Min" operation, let's consider the following Min Heap:

```
           4
         /   \
        7     5
       / \   / \
      10  8 12  9
```

1. The minimum element is 4, so we delete it.
2. After deletion, we replace the root (4) with the rightmost leaf (9).
3. We compare the new root with its children and swap it with the smaller child until the heap property is satisfied.

Visualization:

```
           5
         /   \
        7     9
       / \   
      10  8  
```

## Why You Should Learn It?

Understanding the "Delete at Min" operation in a Min Heap is crucial for anyone working with heaps or priority queues. This operation is commonly used in various algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm and Prim's algorithm, where efficient retrieval of the minimum element is required. By learning this operation, you'll be equipped with a fundamental building block for solving a wide range of problems efficiently.

## Real-life Example

A real-life example of the "Delete at Min" operation can be found in an operating system's task scheduling. Suppose a scheduler uses a Min Heap to maintain the ready queue of tasks, with the priority of each task determined by its execution time. When a task completes its execution, it is deleted from the heap using the "Delete at Min" operation, and the next task with the minimum execution time is scheduled to run.

## How It Works

The "Delete at Min" operation in a Min Heap involves the following steps:

1. Remove the minimum element, which is always at the root of the heap.
2. Replace the root with the rightmost leaf node of the last level.
3. Compare the new root with its children.
4. If the heap property is violated (i.e., the root is greater than any of its children), swap it with the smaller child.
5. Repeat step 4 until the heap property is satisfied for all nodes.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the "Delete at Min" operation in a Min Heap is O(log n

), where n is the number of elements in the heap. This complexity arises from the need to restore the heap property by comparing and swapping nodes. The space complexity is O(1) since the operation only requires a constant amount of additional memory.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- Efficiently retrieves the minimum element from a collection of elements.
- Enables efficient implementation of priority queues and various algorithms.

Disadvantages:
- Modifying the heap structure after deletion requires additional operations.
- Dynamic resizing of the underlying array may be required, resulting in memory reallocation.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for the "Delete at Min" operation in a Min Heap can be summarized as follows:

1. Remove the root element (minimum) from the heap.
2. Replace the root with the rightmost leaf node.
3. Compare the new root with its children.
4. If the heap property is violated, swap the root with the smaller child.
5. Repeat step 4 until the heap property is satisfied for all nodes.

## Pseudocode

Here's the pseudocode for the "Delete at Min" operation:

```
deleteMin():
    if heap is empty:
        return error

    minElement = heap[0]
    lastElement = heap[size - 1]
    size = size - 1
    heap[0] = lastElement
    heapifyDown(0)

    return minElement

heapifyDown(index):
    while index has at least one child:
        smallestChild = leftChild(index)

        if rightChild(index) exists and rightChild(index) < leftChild(index):
            smallestChild = rightChild(index)

        if heap[index] <= heap[smallestChild]:
            break

        swap(heap[index], heap[smallestChild])
        index = smallestChild
```

## Memory Representation with Calculation

To represent a Min Heap in memory, we typically use an array-based implementation. The heap elements are stored in an array, and their positions are determined by their indices. The memory allocation for the heap array depends on the number of elements (n) in the heap.

The memory required for the heap array can be calculated as follows:

- Size of the array (in bytes) = n * sizeof(element type)

For example, if we have a Min Heap with 100 elements, and each element occupies 4 bytes, the memory allocation for the heap array would be:

- Size of the array = 100 * 4 = 400 bytes

## Memory Allocation

Memory allocation for the Min Heap is typically managed by the programming language or runtime environment. When the heap is created, the necessary memory is allocated to hold the specified number of elements. The memory allocation and deallocation processes are abstracted from the user, who only interacts with the heap through its provided operations.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is a memory management technique used by some programming languages and runtime environments to automatically reclaim memory that is no longer needed. In the context of the Min Heap, garbage collection may be employed if the underlying programming language/runtime supports it. The implementation details of garbage collection can vary, but its purpose is to free memory occupied by deleted heap elements.

## Limitations of Delete at Min Heap

- The "Delete at Min" operation can only remove the minimum element in the heap. If you need to delete an element with a specific value, you would need to search for that element first, which has a time complexity of O(n).
- The heap structure may need to be resized dynamically if the number of elements fluctuates significantly, which can lead to additional overhead due to memory allocation and reallocation.
